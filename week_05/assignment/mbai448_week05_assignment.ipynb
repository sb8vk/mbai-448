    "# MBAI 448 | Week 5 Assignment: Transformers and NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Assignment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment explores how transformer-based NLP can be applied to a real-world content enrichment problem in media and entertainment. It is organized into three Acts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Act I: Understand the problem and context\n",
    "- Act II: Prototype a solution with AI technology\n",
    "- Act III: Socialize the work with stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Assignment Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment assumes you will be working with GitHub Copilot in VS Code or Google Colab, and will require you to submit your chat history along with this notebook. If you are curious about how to work effectively with GitHub Copilot, please consult the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions that demonstrate thoughtless interaction with Copilot (e.g., asking Copilot to just read the notebook and produce all the outputs) will receive reduced credit."

The company wants to boost traffic and user engagement, in particular among young professionals. Your boss, the Head of News Content, has just brokered a deal with a new provider to acquire commercial news articles. They want you to help build out a business content section, complete with subsections for \"Good News 🎉\" and \"Bad News 👎\" articles, topical tags, pithy summaries, and a clarifying question about each article.\n",

    "Your `agents.md` must include the following five sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. What we're building\n",
    "A one-sentence \"elevator pitch\" describing the prototype and its primary output (e.g., \"An automated content enrichment system that classifies, tags, summarizes, and generates FAQs for news articles using transformer-based NLP models.\").\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. How AI helps solve the business problem\n",
    "2–4 bullet points explaining the specific value-add of the AI components. Focus on the transition from the business \"pain point\" to the AI \"solution.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Key file locations and data structure\n",
    "List the paths that matter (e.g., `./mbai448_week05_assignment.ipynb`, `./data/news.csv`).\n",
    "\n",

Question answering, 6. Summarization, 7. Full pipeline application). Feel free to ask Copilot for help (or take a peek at the steps in Act II below) for a sense of structuring the work.\n",

    "- **Validate**: Review and refine that plan to ensure it does exactly what the step requires—no more, no less.\n",

    "- **Check**: Perform one or two concrete actions that confirm the code worked and that you understand the result.\n",

    "You have built and evaluated a working prototype for automated content enrichment. Now you need to think about what it would mean to use this system in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this act, you will have conversations with three colleagues who each engage with the system from a different professional perspective. Each one surfaces a distinct set of pressures that emerge when NLP automation is introduced into a real content operation.\n",

    "\n",
    "You will speak with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Content Strategy Lead** focused on how automated tagging and categorization changes editorial workflows — including when editors trust the system, when they override it, and how errors affect content quality and reader trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **Editorial Standards Manager** focused on accountability, accuracy, and brand risk — including what happens when articles are miscategorized or summaries misrepresent content, how decisions are justified after the fact, and whether the system can be relied on for sensitive topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Platform Operations Manager** focused on efficiency and scale — including the tradeoffs between processing speed and accuracy, how the system affects content throughput, and whether gains in automation introduce new forms of friction elsewhere in the pipeline.\n",

    "---\n",

    "### How to Approach These Conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "Each conversation should feel like a real internal discussion about a live prototype.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these interactions, you should be prepared to:\n",
    "- explain how each model behaves in concrete terms,\n",
    "- reference evidence from your prototype (e.g., sample classifications, entity extractions, summaries),\n",
    "- articulate tradeoffs clearly in plain, cross-functional language,\n",
    "- and acknowledge uncertainty where it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "These colleagues are not trying to block the work — but they are responsible for understanding its implications within their domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a colleague has enough information to understand the risks, assumptions, and consequences involved, the conversation will naturally come to a close."
