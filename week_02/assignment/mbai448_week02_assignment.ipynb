        "\n",
        "- Act I: Understand the problem and context\n",
        "- Act II: Prototype a solution with AI technology\n",
        "- Act III: Socialize the work with stakeholders\n",

        "This assignment assumes you will be working with Github Copilot in VS Code, and will require you to submit your chat history along with this notebook. If you are curious about how to work effectively with Github Copilot, please consult the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview).\n",
