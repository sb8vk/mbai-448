    "# MBAI 448 | Week 2 Assignment: Image Embeddings as Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Assignment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment explores how data representations can be applied to a real-world problem. It is organized into three Acts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Act I: Understand the problem and context\n",
    "- Act II: Prototype a solution with AI technology\n",
    "- Act III: Socialize the work with stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Assignment Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment assumes you will be working with Github Copilot in VS Code, and will require you to submit your chat history along with this notebook. If you are curious about how to work effectively with Github Copilot, please consult the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions that demonstrate thoughtless interaction with Copilot (e.g., asking Copilot to just read the notebook and produce all the outputs) will receive reduced credit."

    "**Relevant Industry and/or Business Function:** E-commerce\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** You report to the VP of digital experience at upstart clothing e-commerce company HIM Holdings.  They have found that the more text searches a customer makes on their app, the less likely that customer is to make a purchase.  They want you to explore how AI could help customers to better find what they are looking for.\n",

    "#### Step 0 : Scope the work in `agents.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving forward, create a a file named `agents.md` in the project root directory (likely the same level of the directory in which this notebook lives). This file specifies the intended role of AI in this project and serves as reference context for Github Copilot as you work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your `agents.md` must include the following five sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. What we’re building\n",
    "A one-sentence \"elevator pitch\" describing the prototype and its primary output (e.g., \"A predictive lead-scoring engine that identifies high-value customers based on historical CRM data.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. How AI helps solve the business problem\n",
    "2–4 bullet points explaining the specific value-add of the AI components. Focus on the transition from the business \"pain point\" to the AI \"solution.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Key file locations and data structure\n",
    "List the paths that matter (e.g., `notebooks/exploration.ipynb`, `data/raw_leads.csv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. High-level execution plan\n",
    "A step-by-step outline of the build process (e.g., 1. Data cleaning, 2. Feature engineering, 3. Model training, 4. Visualization of results). Feel free to ask Copilot for help (or take a peek at the steps in Act II below) for a sense on structuring the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Code conventions and constraints\n",
    "To ensure the prototype remains manageable, add 1-2 bullet points specifying that code be as simple and straightforward, using standard libraries unless instructed otherwise."

    "## Prototyping an Encoder-Based Search System\n",
    "\n",
    "In this act, you will prototype an encoder-based search system that compares items based on learned representations rather than exact matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an exploratory prototype. The goal is to understand how encoder-based representations behave in practice: how similarity emerges, what those similarities capture, and where they fail to align with the problem you are trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to use GitHub Copilot throughout. For each step, follow the same disciplined loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plan**: Have Copilot create a short, narrative plan describing what needs to happen and what artifacts will be produced.\n",
    "- **Validate**: Review and revise that plan until it is complete, coherent, and aligned with the purpose of the step.\n",
    "- **Execute**: Once the plan is validated, have Copilot implement it in code.\n",
    "- **Check**: Use the resulting code to perform one or two concrete actions that confirm you have what you need.\n",

    "##### On MacOS/Linux:\n",

    "`python -m venv venv\n",

    "- articulating tradeoffs in plain, cross-functional language,\n",
    "- and reckoning with how technical choices intersect with human expectations, organizational processes, and downstream impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each conversation should feel like a real internal discussion. When a persona has what they need to understand your reasoning and its implications, the conversation will naturally come to a close.\n"
