    "\n",
    "This assignment explores how statistical learning can be applied to a real-world problem. It is organized into three Acts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Act I: Understand the problem and context\n",
    "- Act II: Prototype a solution with AI technology\n",
    "- Act III: Socialize the work with stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Assignment Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment assumes you will be working with Github Copilot in VS Code, and will require you to submit your chat history along with this notebook. If you are curious about how to work effectively with Github Copilot, please consult the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview).\n",

    "**Description:** You report to the new Director of Talent Development at Zaibatsu, a large industrial conglomerate.  Given the tight labor market, one of their top priorities is improving employee retention.  They have shared with you a personnel file of company employees, and are looking for your help to understand and ultimately predict employee attrition.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before moving forward, create a a file named `agents.md` in the project root directory (likely the same level of the directory in which this notebook lives). This file specifies the intended role of AI in this project and serves as reference context for Github Copilot as you work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your `agents.md` must include the following five sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. What we’re building\n",
    "A one-sentence \"elevator pitch\" describing the prototype and its primary output (e.g., \"A predictive lead-scoring engine that identifies high-value customers based on historical CRM data.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. How AI helps solve the business problem\n",
    "2–4 bullet points explaining the specific value-add of the AI components. Focus on the transition from the business \"pain point\" to the AI \"solution.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Key file locations and data structure\n",
    "List the paths that matter (e.g., `./mbai448_week03_assignment.ipynb`, `./data/attrition.csv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. High-level execution plan\n",
    "A step-by-step outline of the build process (e.g., 1. Data processing, 2. Model training, 3. Evaluation, 4. Model tuning). Feel free to ask Copilot for help (or take a peek at the steps in Act II below) for a sense on structuring the work.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this act, you will prototype a workflow that uses employee data to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- segment the workforce into groups using unsupervised learning, and  \n",
    "- train classifiers that estimate attrition risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is meant to be an exploratory prototype, to better understand how how employee representations, clustering approaches, and predictive models can help to anticipate employee attrition.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to use GitHub Copilot throughout. For each step, follow the same disciplined loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plan**: Have Copilot create a short, narrative plan describing what needs to happen and what artifacts will be produced.\n",
    "- **Validate**: Review and revise that plan until it is complete, coherent, and aligned with the purpose of the step.\n",
    "- **Execute**: Once the plan is validated, have Copilot implement it in code.\n",
    "- **Check**: Use the resulting code to perform one or two concrete actions that confirm you have what you need.\n",
