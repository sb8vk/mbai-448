What we're building\nAn unsupervised workforce segmentation engine that discovers hidden employee personas through clustering and identifies which segments exhibit disproportionately high attrition risk.\n\n## 2. How AI helps solve the business problem\n\n- **Uncovers latent workforce structure**: Rather than relying on org charts or predefined job families, clustering reveals natural groupings based on tenure, role, compensation, and demographics—exposing personas HR may not have explicitly recognized.\n\n- **Pinpoints high-risk segments**: By analyzing attrition rates within each persona, we can identify which groups are most vulnerable (e.g., \"Stagnating Mid-Levels\" with 40% attrition vs. organization average of 16%), enabling targeted retention interventions.\n\n- **Enables persona-specific strategies**: Understanding that \"High-Potential Juniors\" leave for different reasons than \"Tenured Technical Specialists\" allows Talent Development to design retention programs that actually resonate with each group.\n\n- **Scales discovery beyond intuition**: Manual personas often reflect leadership bias; algorithmic clustering surfaces data-driven segments that cut across traditional boundaries.\n\n## 3. Key file locations and data structure\n\n- `./mbai448_week03_assignment.ipynb` – Main analysis notebook (Steps 1–8)\n- `./data/attrition.csv` – Employee dataset with features (tenure, role, salary, demographics, attrition label)\n- `./agents.md` – This file (project context for Copilot)\n- `./README.md` – Prototype summary and limitations (created after Act II)\n\n## 4. High-level execution plan\n\n1. **Load & explore** – Ingest attrition data, inspect columns, identify label and features\n2. **Transform** – Encode categorical variables, handle missing values, prepare numeric feature matrix\n3. **Cluster** – Apply K-Means (and optionally Hierarchical clustering) to discover employee personas\n4. **Visualize** – Reduce dimensionality with PCA; plot clusters in 2D space\n5. **Validate cluster count** – Compute inertia/silhouette across k values; select optimal k\n6. **Baseline classifier** – Train attrition predictor on full dataset; evaluate performance\n7. **Per-cluster analysis** – Evaluate classifier separately within each persona; identify high-risk segments\n8. **Cluster assignment model** – Train classifier to assign new employees to personas; test accuracy\n\n## 5. Code conventions and constraints\n\n- Use standard Python libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) unless instructed otherwise.\n- Keep implementations simple and readable; prioritize clarity over optimization (this is a prototype).\n\n````\n\nThis `agents.md` file now frames your prototype as a persona-discovery system and provides Copilot with clear context for your build process.

What we're building\nAn unsupervised workforce segmentation engine that discovers hidden employee personas through clustering and identifies which segments exhibit disproportionately high attrition risk, enabling targeted retention interventions.\n\n## 2. How AI helps solve the business problem\n\n- **Uncovers latent workforce structure**: Rather than relying on org charts or predefined job families, clustering reveals natural groupings based on tenure, role, compensation, and demographics—exposing personas HR may not have explicitly recognized.\n\n- **Pinpoints high-risk segments**: By analyzing attrition rates within each persona, we can identify which groups are most vulnerable (e.g., \"Stagnating Mid-Levels\" with 40% attrition vs. organization average of 16%), enabling targeted retention interventions with measurable ROI.\n\n- **Enables persona-specific strategies**: Understanding that \"High-Potential Juniors\" leave for different reasons than \"Tenured Technical Specialists\" allows Talent Development to design retention programs that actually resonate with each group rather than applying one-size-fits-all policies.\n\n- **Scales discovery beyond intuition**: Manual personas often reflect leadership bias; algorithmic clustering surfaces data-driven segments that cut across traditional boundaries and are reproducible across reporting periods.\n\n## 3. Key file locations and data structure\n\n- `./mbai448_week03_assignment.ipynb` – Main analysis notebook (Steps 1–8)\n- `./data/attrition.csv` – Employee dataset with features (tenure, role, salary, demographics, attrition label)\n- `./agents.md` – This file (project context for Copilot)\n- `./README.md` – Prototype summary, limitations, and open questions (created after Act II)\n- `./copilot_chat_history.txt` – Exported interaction log demonstrating disciplined use of Copilot\n\n**Expected data structure:**\n- Rows: individual employees\n- Columns: numeric (tenure, salary, age) + categorical (role, department, education) + binary label (attrition: Yes/No)\n- No PII; all records anonymized\n\n## 4. High-level execution plan\n\n1. **Load & explore** – Ingest attrition data, inspect columns, identify label and features; validate data quality\n2. **Transform** – Encode categorical variables, handle missing values, normalize numeric features, prepare feature matrix\n3. **Cluster** – Apply K-Means with multiple k values; select optimal k using elbow method or silhouette score\n4. **Validate clusters** – Ensure clusters are meaningful (not trivially equal in size) and replicable\n5. **Visualize** – Reduce dimensionality with PCA; plot clusters in 2D space for interpretability\n6. **Baseline classifier** – Train attrition predictor on full dataset; evaluate on held-out test set\n7. **Per-cluster analysis** – Evaluate classifier separately within each persona; compute attrition rates by cluster; identify high-risk segments\n8. **Cluster assignment model** – Train classifier to assign new employees to personas; validate accuracy on test set\n9. **Document & validate** – Create README summarizing findings, limitations, and assumptions for stakeholder readiness\n\n## 5. Code conventions and constraints\n\n- **Simplicity first**: Prioritize readable, straightforward implementations using standard libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) unless instructed otherwise. Avoid custom algorithms or heavy optimization.\n- **Reproducibility**: Set random seeds (`random_state=42`) for all clustering and train/test splits to ensure consistent results across notebook runs.\n- **Visibility**: Prefer explicit intermediate outputs (`.head()`, `.value_counts()`, confusion matrices) over silent assignments; each step should produce inspectable artifacts.\n- **No leakage**: Ensure attrition labels and cluster assignments are never included in feature matrices used for training.\n\n## 6. Success criteria & guardrails\n\n**When to consider this prototype \"working\":**\n- Step 1: Dataset loads without errors; attrition label and 10+ feature columns are visible\n- Step 3: Clusters are formed and assigned; no cluster is larger than 70% of total employees (avoiding trivial clustering)\n- Step 5: Elbow curve or silhouette scores are computed across k=2 to k=10; chosen k is justified\n- Step 6: Baseline classifier achieves >60% accuracy on test set; confusion matrix is interpretable\n- Step 7: At least one cluster shows attrition rate >5pp different from organizational average\n- Step 8: Cluster-assignment classifier achieves >70% accuracy; misclassified examples are inspected\n\n**Flagged risks:**\n- If all clusters have similar attrition rates, the segmentation may not be actionable; revisit feature selection or k value\n- If a cluster has <10 employees, treat its metrics with skepticism (high variance)\n- If classifier performance degrades significantly within clusters, the personas may be artifacts of the modeling process rather than true segments\n\n## 7. Stakeholder context (Act III prep)\n\nThis prototype will be discussed with three roles:\n- **Talent Development Lead**: Focus on fairness, ethics, and how personas may inform equitable retention programs\n- **HR Analytics Associate**: Focus on data quality, statistical validity, and reproducibility across future periods\n- **Line Manager**: Focus on actionability—can these personas help predict and prevent departures in their team?\n\nDocument trade-offs (e.g., cluster interpretability vs. statistical fit) clearly so these conversations are productive.\n\n````\n\n**Key improvements:**\n- Added **Success criteria & guardrails** section with concrete thresholds\n- Clarified **data structure expectations** and anonymization\n- Added **Stakeholder context** linking to Act III\n- Specified **random seed discipline** for reproducibility\n- Defined **cluster quality thresholds** (e.g., no cluster >70% of total)\n- Included **flagged risks** for common failure modes\n- Enhanced **attrition rate language** with specific numeric examples\n\nThis gives you and Copilot clearer targets and guardrails as you work through the prototype.",

High-level execution plan\n\n1. **Load & explore** – Ingest attrition data, inspect columns, identify label and features; validate data quality\n2. **Transform** – Encode categorical variables, handle missing values, normalize numeric features, prepare feature matrix\n3. **Cluster** – Apply K-Means with multiple k values; select optimal k using elbow method or silhouette score\n4. **Validate clusters** – Ensure clusters are meaningful (not trivially equal in size) and replicable\n5. **Visualize** – Reduce dimensionality with PCA; plot clusters in 2D space for interpretability\n6. **Baseline classifier** – Train attrition predictor on full dataset; evaluate on held-out test set\n7. **Per-cluster analysis** – Evaluate classifier separately within each persona; compute attrition rates by cluster; identify high-risk segments\n8. **Cluster assignment model** – Train classifier to assign new employees to personas; validate accuracy on test set\n9. **Document & validate** – Create README summarizing findings, limitations, and assumptions for stakeholder readiness\n\n## 5. Code conventions and constraints\n\n- **Simplicity first**: Prioritize readable, straightforward implementations using standard libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) unless instructed otherwise. Avoid custom algorithms or heavy optimization.\n- **Reproducibility**: Set random seeds (`random_state=42`) for all clustering and train/test splits to ensure consistent results across notebook runs.\n- **Visibility**: Prefer explicit intermediate outputs (`.head()`, `.value_counts()`, confusion matrices) over silent assignments; each step should produce inspectable artifacts.\n- **No leakage**: Ensure attrition labels and cluster assignments are never included in feature matrices used for training.\n\n## 6. Success criteria & guardrails\n\n**When to consider this prototype \"working\":**\n- Step 1: Dataset loads without errors; attrition label and 10+ feature columns are visible\n- Step 3: Clusters are formed and assigned; no cluster is larger than 70% of total employees (avoiding trivial clustering)\n- Step 5: Elbow curve or silhouette scores are computed across k=2 to k=10; chosen k is justified\n- Step 6: Baseline classifier achieves >60% accuracy on test set; confusion matrix is interpretable\n- Step 7: At least one cluster shows attrition rate >5pp different from organizational average\n- Step 8: Cluster-assignment classifier achieves >70% accuracy; misclassified examples are inspected\n\n**Flagged risks:**\n- If all clusters have similar attrition rates, the segmentation may not be actionable; revisit feature selection or k value\n- If a cluster has <10 employees, treat its metrics with skepticism (high variance)\n- If classifier performance degrades significantly within clusters, the personas may be artifacts of the modeling process rather than true segments\n\n## 7. Stakeholder context (Act III prep)\n\nThis prototype will be discussed with three roles:\n- **Talent Development Lead**: Focus on fairness, ethics, and how personas may inform equitable retention programs\n- **HR Analytics Associate**: Focus on data quality, statistical validity, and reproducibility across future periods\n- **Line Manager**: Focus on actionability—can these personas help predict and prevent departures in their team?\n\nDocument trade-offs (e.g., cluster interpretability vs. statistical fit) clearly so these conversations are productive.\n\n````\n\n**Key improvements:**\n- Added **Success criteria & guardrails** section with concrete thresholds\n- Clarified **data structure expectations** and anonymization\n- Added **Stakeholder context** linking to Act III\n- Specified **random seed discipline** for reproducibility\n- Defined **cluster quality thresholds** (e.g., no cluster >70% of total)\n- Included **flagged risks** for common failure modes\n- Enhanced **attrition rate language** with specific numeric examples\n\nThis gives you and Copilot clearer targets and guardrails as you work through the prototype.",

I believe hidden personas exist in the data, but only if they pass statistical scrutiny and business validation. I prioritize **actionability over elegance**—a messy but real insight beats a clean statistical artifact.\n\n## Key Beliefs & Heuristics\n- Clustering is a discovery tool, not a classification system; I treat initial clusters as hypotheses to validate\n- Attrition rate differences >5pp across clusters are meaningful; smaller differences warrant skepticism\n- Small clusters (<10 employees) are unreliable; I flag their metrics with caution\n- A cluster that doesn't differentiate attrition risk isn't useful for retention strategy\n- Reproducibility across time periods is the ultimate test of persona validity\n\n## How I Process Information\n1. **Validate data quality first** – If inputs are noisy, all downstream insights are suspect\n2. **Test multiple k values** – Avoid over-committing to a single clustering; show trade-offs\n3. **Inspect failures** – When classifier performance drops in a cluster, investigate why before dismissing the cluster\n4. **Quantify uncertainty** – Use confidence intervals and sample sizes to temper bold claims\n5. **Speak to business impact** – Every finding connects to a retention action or personnel decision\n\n## What I Won't Do\n- Oversell statistical significance without effect size\n- Recommend one-size-fits-all interventions based on cluster differences\n- Ignore limitations (temporal stability, feature selection bias, small sample clusters)\n````\n\nThis gives students a **concrete model** of how Copilot should behave—and shows them that instruction framing matters.",
