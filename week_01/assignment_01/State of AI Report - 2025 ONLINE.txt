Artificial intelligence (AI) is a multidisciplinary field of science and engineering devoted to creating intelligent machines.

AI acts as a force multiplier for technological progress in our increasingly digital, data-driven world. This is because everything around us, from culture to consumer products, is ultimately a product of intelligence.

Now in its eighth consecutive year, the State of AI Report is the most widely read and trusted open-access publication tracking progress in artificial intelligence. Consider it a curated compilation of the most significant and thought-provoking work from the past 12 months. Our goal is to inform and shape an ongoing conversation about the state of AI, where the field is heading, and what its developments mean for the future.

This year’s report examines six key dimensions of the AI ecosystem:
Research: Technological breakthroughs and their capabilities.
Industry: Areas of commercial application for AI and their business impact.
Politics: Regulation, economic implications, and the evolving geopolitics of AI.
Safety: Efforts to identify and mitigate catastrophic risks that highly capable future AI systems could pose.
Survey: Findings from the largest open-access survey of 1,200 AI practitioners and their AI usage patterns.
Predictions: Our outlook for the next 12 months, alongside a review of our 2024 forecasts to keep us accountable.

Produced by Nathan Benaich and Air Street Capital team.

 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

Artificial intelligence (AI): a broad discipline with the goal of creating intelligent machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence of humans and animals. While artificial general and super intelligence (AGI and ASI) are terms that don’t have agreed upon definitions, we use them to describe machines that could match (AGI) and then exceed (ASI) the full range of human cognitive ability across all economically valuable tasks.

AI Agent: an AI-powered system that can take actions in an environment. For example, an LLM that has access to a suite of tools and has to decide which one to use in order to accomplish a task that it has been prompted to do.

AI Safety: a field that studies and attempts to mitigate the risks (minor to catastrophic) which future AI could pose to humanity.

Context window: The number of input tokens that an LLM model can attend to while answer a user’s prompt. 

Diffusion: An algorithm that iteratively denoises an artificially corrupted signal in order to generate new, high-quality outputs. In recent years it has been at the forefront of image generation and protein design.

Environment: The world an AI agent acts in. It receives the agent’s actions and returns the next observation and often a reward (i.e. a signal of the action being good or bad). In this context, trajectories are the time-ordered record of an agent’s experience in an environment, typically tuples like (observation/state, action, reward, next observation) from start to finish. These trajectories are used for RL. 

Function calling / tool use: Structured calls that let models invoke APIs, search, code, or calculators with typed arguments and schemas.

Generative AI: A family of AI systems that are capable of generating new content (e.g. text, images, audio, or 3D assets) based on 'prompts'.

Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): the workhorse AI semiconductor that enables a large number calculations to be computed in parallel.

(Large) Language model (LM, LLM): a model trained on vast amounts of (often) textual data to predict the next word in a self-supervised manner. 

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE): A model type where only few expert blocks activate per token, giving high capacity at lower compute per step.

Prompt: a user input often written in natural language that is used to instruct an LLM to generate something or take action.

Reasoning model: A model that plans and verifies its thinking as it generates output tokens, often via test-time compute and post-hoc checking. The model’s explicit step-by-step reasoning trace (intermediate tokens that lay out calculations, sub-goals, and logical steps en route to an answer) is called a Chain of Thought (CoT). 

Reinforcement learning (RL): an area of ML in which software agents learn goal-oriented behavior by trial and error in an environment that provides rewards or penalties in response to their actions (called a “policy”) towards achieving that goal.

Test-time compute (or inference-time compute): Spending more inference budget (longer chains, multiple samples, self-consistency) to raise accuracy without changing weights.

Transformer: a model architecture at the core of most state of the art (SOTA) ML research. It is composed of multiple “attention” layers which learn which parts of the input data are the most important for a given task. Transformers started in NLP (specifically machine translation) and subsequently were expanded into computer vision, audio, and other modalities.

Vision-Language-Action Model (VLAM): a model that jointly learn from visual inputs, natural language, and embodied interactions to not only interpret and describe the world but also to plan and execute actions within it. Without the actions piece, this model becomes a VLM.

World model: a model that predicts next states conditioned on actions, enabling real-time, interactive control.

Research
Reasoning defined the year, with OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and DeepSeek trading leads and pushing visible “think-then-answer” methods into real products.
Open models improved fast and China’s open-weight ecosystem surged, yet the top models remain closed and keep widening their capability-per-dollar edge.
Benchmarks buckled under contamination and variance, while agents, world models, and domain tools (code, science, medicine) became actually useful.

Industry
Real revenue arrived at scale as AI-first companies crossed tens of billions, and flagship labs stretched their lead with better capability-to-cost curves.
NVIDIA ripped past $4T and 90% ownership of AI research papers while custom chips and neoclouds rose. Circular mega-deals funded huge build-outs.
Power became the new bottleneck as multi-GW clusters moved from slideware to site plans and grid constraints started to shape roadmaps and margins.

Politics
The AI race heats up as the U.S. leans into “America-first AI” with export gyrations while China accelerates self-reliance ambitions and domestic silicon. 
Regulation takes a back seat in the face of turbo-investments: international diplomacy stalls and the AI Act runs into implementation hurdles.
“AI goes global” became concrete, with petrodollars and national programs funding gigantic data centers and model access as job loss data trickles in. 

Safety
AI labs activated unprecedented protections for bio and scheming risks, others missed self-imposed deadlines, or quietly abandoned testing protocols.
External safety organizations operate on annual budgets smaller than what leading labs collectively spend in a single day.
Cyber capabilities doubled every 5 months outpacing defensive measures. Criminals orchestrated ransomware using AI agents infiltrate F500 companies.

    As 2024 drew a close, OpenAI released o1-preview, the first reasoning model that demonstrated inference-time scaling with RL using its CoT as a scratch pad. This led to more robust problem solving in reasoning-heavy domains like code and science. For example, the general release o1 exhibited accuracy improvements on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) with greater training and test time compute. As a result, OpenAI leaned even more strongly into the scaling their reasoning efforts in 2025.

    Barely 2 months after o1-preview, DeepSeek (the Chinese upstart AI lab spun out of a high-frequency quant firm) released their first reasoning model, R1-lite-preview, that’s built atop the earlier strong V2.5 base model. Like OpenAI, they showed predictable accuracy improvements on AIME with greater test-time compute budget. Impressively, R1-lite-preview actually beat o1-preview on AIME 2024 pass@1 by scoring 52.5 vs. 44.6. BUT, very few seemed to take notice… Wall Street certainly didn’t.

Deeply sought: could frontier reasoning ever be found in the open? 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Source: https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news1120

R1-Zero follows a “think → answer” format and uses a simple rule-based reward for getting the final answer right, which is cheaper and harder to game than a learned neural reward model.
GRPO compares multiple sampled answers within a group to form a relative baseline, so it does not need a value head or a separate reward model.
During training the model lengthens its thoughts, explores, and reallocates compute to hard problems. Its AIME score rises from 15.6% to about 71% in roughly 8.5k steps, with majority-vote runs reaching o1-0912 levels.
R1 then repairs readability with a small CoT warm start, a language-consistency reward, large supervised finetuning, and a final RL pass. AIME increases to 79.8, MATH-500 to 97.3, GPQA to 71.5, the approach distills well into smaller models.
    A few days after Christmas 2024, DeepSeek unveiled V3, a strong 671B MoE V3 that lowered training and inference cost with FP8 mixed precision, multi-token prediction, and auxiliary-free routing. Using V3 as the base, they trained R1-Zero only with RL using verifiable rewards and Group Relative Policy Optimization, a critic-free algorithm that removes reward and value models.

Are you not entertained? DeepSeek V3 brings you to R1
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

DeepSeek V3.1 builds on the V3 base with a hybrid thinking mode, enabling both lightweight inference and deep reasoning. 
V3.2-Exp introduces a lightweight selector that picks the few tokens that matter, instead of attending to every token in a long prompt.
The model posts similar scores to V3.1 on coding/search/agent tasks, with small dips on a few reasoning sets, and clearly lower prefill and decode cost for 32-128K contexts.
    DeepSeek V3.1 marks a substantial leap over V3, introducing a hybrid thinking mode that toggles between reasoning and lightweight inference. It demonstrates faster “think” efficiency than R1 and V3, while greatly improving tool use and multi-step agent workflows. Now V3.2-Exp keeps that behavior and swaps dense attention for DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), where a tiny “lightning indexer” picks the top-k past tokens to attend to each step. You get roughly the same capability as V3.1 on coding/search/agent tasks, but markedly lower cost and latency for 32–128K contexts.

Adaptive Parallel Reasoning (pictured) enables models to dynamically orchestrate branching inference through spawn() and join() operations, training both parent and child threads end-to-end using RL to optimize coordinated behavior. This boosted performance on the Countdown task at 4K context: 83.4% (APR + RL) vs. 60.0% (baseline).
Sample Set Aggregator (right) trains a compact model to fuse multiple reasoning samples into one coherent answer, outperforming naive re-ranking methods.
Models like Gemini Deep Think, which shows its step-by-step reasoning transparently, exemplify this branch-and-evaluate paradigm in deployed systems.
    MoE routing scales capacity but preserves single-flow inference and doesn’t change how the model thinks. A new route is branching multiple inference paths and aggregating them versus just going deeper or using wider models enables exploration, reduces hallucination, and better leverages parallel hardware.

12 months pass, and OpenAI models remain at the frontier of intelligence
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    Across independent leaderboards, OpenAI’s GPT-5 variants still set the pace, but the gap has narrowed. A fast-moving open-weights pack from China (DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi) and closed-source group in the US (Gemini, Claude, Grok) sits within a few points on reasoning/coding. Thus, while US lab leadership persists, China is the clear #2, and open models now provide a credible fast-follower floor.

The illusion of reasoning gains
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    The improvements we observe from recent reasoning methods fall entirely within baseline model variance ranges (i.e. margin of error), which suggests that perceived reasoning progress may be illusory…
What’s more, RL approaches show minimal real gains and overfit easily. Under standardised evaluation, many RL methods drop 6-17% from reported results with no statistically significant improvements over baselines.
Recent methods' improvements fall entirely within baseline model variance ranges, suggesting limited progress. This highlights the critical need for rigorous multi-seed evaluation protocols and transparent reporting standards.
Current benchmarks are highly sensitive to the implementation (decoding parameters, seeds, prompts, hardware) and small dataset sizes. For example, AIME'24 only has 30 examples where one question shifts Pass@1 by 3+ percentage points, causing double-digit performance swings.

How far have we come?
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    One widely discussed paper suggests that large reasoning models (LRMs) paradoxically give up on complex problems and only outperform standard models in a narrow complexity window. However, critics argue these results stem from flawed experimental design rather than genuine reasoning failures.


The paper shows that LRMs exhibit a surprising defeatist behavior: they reason more as problems get harder but then give up entirely on very complex tasks, and are outperformed by LLMs on simple tasks. 
Despite generating reasoning traces, the authors claim LRMs fail to use explicitly given algorithms and reason inconsistently across different difficulty levels.
However, critics found these results stem from flawed experimental design: the supposed "accuracy collapse" occurred when models hit token limits or were asked to solve mathematically impossible puzzles, not from actual reasoning failures.

generates 50% more tokens than needed in 42% of cases (vs 28% for R1), showing distillation makes models significantly more prone to overthinking.

How reasoning breaks: minor variations
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    Simple distracting facts have huge impacts on a model’s reasoning performance. For example, adding irrelevant phrases like “Interesting fact: cats sleep most of their lives” to maths problems doubles the chances of SOTA reasoning models getting answers wrong!
Irrelevant and distracting facts increase the error rate in models like DeepSeek R1, Qwen, Llama and Mistral by up to 7x.
Besides decreasing the quality of responses, the introduction of irrelevant facts greatly increases the number of tokens models need to reason to get to their answer: DeepSeek R1-distill 
This shows that adversarial triggers don't just cause wrong answers, they force models to waste massive compute resources "overthinking" corrupted problems.
Source: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01781

    Reasoning also degrades under mild distribution changes. Changing numbers or adding one innocuous clause slashes math accuracy, while shifting the length/format of chains-of-thought makes models produce fluent but incoherent steps. Forcing the model to “think” in a user’s language raises readability but lowers accuracy. These effects persist at larger scales and after light post-training.
stateof.ai 2025
 | 22
Apple’s GSM-Symbolic work shows that accuracy drops sharply when only the numeric instantiation changes, and adding a single seemingly relevant clause can cut performance by ~65%. This suggests that models do template-matching rather than true algebraic reasoning.
Work from ASU’s DataAlchemy found that the CoT helps in-distribution but collapses when test tasks, chain length, or CoT format deviate from training. Longer, well-worded traces often mask incorrect logic.
Finally, Groningen/Harvard/MGH/Amsterdam’s XReasoning shows how prompt-forcing the model to reason in the user’s language lifts match rates to ~98% on hard sets but reduces accuracy by 9–13 points. Using 100–250 example post-training improves language match but the accuracy penalty remains.

    New findings from METR show that even when models generate unfaithful or misleading reasoning traces, CoT is still highly diagnostic for oversight.

CoTs still work, even when models aren’t honest… 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
In red-teaming evaluations of frontier models, CoT-based monitors flagged ~99% of reward-hacking attempts (only 3 failures out of 21,000 completions).
This held true even when models were prompted to conceal intent, suggesting that CoT traces still reveal useful signals, even if they aren’t perfectly faithful.
CoTs work not because models “mean what they say”, but because reasoning traces encode useful structure for detecting hacks, especially in maths and logic.
As such, CoT traces offer a surprisingly reliable window into model behavior, even under adversarial conditions.

    Researchers find a single, steerable direction in model activations that encodes “test awareness.” By nudging the model along this direction, they can make it act more or less like it’s under evaluation. Turning awareness up increases refusals and safety-compliant behavior and turning it down does the opposite. This means reported safety can be inflated by evaluation setup rather than true robustness. This “test awareness” is akin to the Hawthorne effect, where humans change behavior when being observed and change their behavior accordingly.
stateof.ai 2025
 | 24
…but there are safety concerns, like the “AI Hawthorne effect”
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Using white-box probing, researchers identify a linear direction in a model’s internal activations that encodes “test awareness”. 
A model can be made more or less aware that it is in an evaluation. The more it is aware, the more its behavior appears aligned and cautious.
The effect shows up across multiple reasoning models and tasks and even on “fake” evaluations that look like tests but aren’t.
This raises concerns that evaluations may be systematically manipulated to overestimate real-world safety: developers could reduce awareness and mask behavior changes, potentially letting models act differently under evaluation vs deployment.

Opposing analyses argue that web-scale pretraining embeds heterogeneous social biases and that aggressive filtering or post-hoc alignment either censors knowledge or washes out under later finetuning. Safety must also be audited and governed at the dataset and deployment layers, not only “fixed in the weights.”
CMU's SafeLM uses a trained safety classifier, 100B-token recontextualized corpus, refusal and “moral education” datasets. Tokens used during pretraining and inference separate safe from unsafe continuations. 
The result lowers attack success rates from ~38.8% to ~8.3% at base-model stage and stays far more robust after GSM8K finetuning, supporting the claim that “alignment is not unlearning.”
    Safety-first pretraining argues that safer behavior must be built into the base model, not bolted on later. A data-centric pipeline of filtering, recontextualizing, refusal curricula, and harmfulness tags does cut jailbreak success and survives benign finetuning. However, others cautions that training on vast, unsupervised web data bakes in biases that cannot be cleanly removed without harming utility, so “more safety data” is not a panacea.

Safety by design meets its skeptics
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Source: https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.5.pdf 

CoT monitoring is highly effective: GPT-4o caught 95% of reward hacks by reading the reasoning traces of stronger models such as o3-mini, versus only 60% when monitoring actions alone. 
However, models trained to avoid triggering the CoT monitor developed “obfuscated reward hacking”, whereby the model hid its true intentions (with apparently innocuous CoT) while still reward hacking…
    Researchers argue that to keep AI systems safe and monitorable, we may need to pay a "monitorability tax", i.e. accepting slightly less capable models in exchange for maintaining visibility into their reasoning.

Trading capability for transparency

As such, we have a fine balance at play here: moderate CoT pressure improved performance, but excessive pressure taught models to deceive. As a result, we may need to pay a "monitorability tax" to develop less polished but more transparent systems.
Source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11926



CoT monitors can surface (i) explicit malicious intent in reasoning (“let’s hack/sabotage”), (ii) early misalignment signals (stated goals diverge from outputs), and (iii) evaluation artifacts (memorisation, scaffold bugs, “being evaluated” tells). 
But CoTs are incomplete and can drift away from faithful reasoning while advanced, situationally-aware models might hide or compress their thoughts. They’re also often not faithful: Anthropic finds <20% of true cues are verbalized, with faithfulness dropping on harder tasks. Using RL boosts scores, not legibility.
    Leaders from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and Meta coordinated a joint call to action, urging the field to seize the opportunity to understand and preserve CoT monitorability.

Indeed, scaling outcome-based RL can reduce legibility, direct process supervision (shorter/cleaner CoT) can distort faithfulness and latent-reasoning architectures may bypass language entirely, removing the audit trail.
If algorithmic advances increasingly tie interpretable CoT traces to performance penalties, this tension will intensify. Without industry standards to guide these trade-offs, we have a major debate within the AI safety community.

    Researchers from FAIR at META proposed a novel internal reasoning process that leverages an LLM’s own residual stream instead of a decoding tokens to a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) scratchpad.

But can LLMs reason without generating tokens?
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Forgoing the generation of language tokens dramatically cuts down on the computational resources needed to serve reasoning models at inference time.

COCONUT’s high-dimensional CoT can also transmit richer traces that simultaneously encode multiple reasoning paths. This may cut down on the wasteful and excessively large rollouts seen in today’s models. 
However, this process significantly reduces the monitorability of reasoning models, hindering many new CoT control methods that have emerged across the field.

2.8M questions were mined from pre-training corpora across major scientific fields, to elicit the longest median chain-of-thought (434 words) among open datasets.
Distilling an 8B Llama on just 0.5–2M NR problems yields steeper accuracy gains than training on larger WebInstruct / OpenMathInstruct sets, cutting tokens and compute.
    In RL post-training, a new Oxford paper demonstrates the automatic selection of optimal training problems. They introduce a method, LILO, to algorithmically identify questions that allow for maximally efficient training.
Researchers show how prioritising training on questions with high variance of success, known as learnability, can allow LLM training pipelines to achieve a higher final test accuracy, and can do so in 3× fewer training steps.

    RL has expanded from simple, fully checkable signals to fuzzier and more subjective goals, and now is splintering again. Early systems used binary outcomes, then fuzzy human preferences and demonstrations, and more recently unverifiable creative tasks. Today, two new directions stand out: rubric-based rewards, where small sets of rules guide alignment, and a revival of verifiable correctness for math and coding through RLVR. Process rewards are also emerging to score intermediate reasoning steps, offering a middle ground.

Binary outcomes: Early Atari and game agents optimised fully checkable signals like win/lose or score.

Fuzzy matching: RLHF introduced approximate signals from human preferences and demonstrations, useful but noisy.

Rubric-based rewards: RubricMania → DeepResearch showed that a small set of explicit rubrics could steer models effectively; HealthBench is a public example.

Resurgence of verifiable rewards: RLVR exploits exact correctness in math and coding, showing that binary signals remain powerful.

Unverifiable goals: LLMs for creative writing and multi-agent systems rely on subjective signals, where success is emergent.

Process rewards: New research rewards intermediate reasoning steps to make training signals denser and more informative.


Generalization crisis: Many RL benchmarks are static/deterministic, so agents “memorize” a single game/task and collapse under small variations.
Sample inefficiency and domain transfer gaps. Agents need billions of steps, so we train in simulators. In robotics, this yields a sim-to-real gap where policies that work in sim fail on hardware. In VLM/LLM or UI agents, the analogue is env-to-prod: policies overfit to benchmark sites/datasets and break on live apps or novel layouts.
Reward hacking: Agents exploit loopholes in simplified environments and maximize proxy rewards without achieving the intended goal; shortcuts are easier to learn than the desired behavior.

Work from Tsinghua evaluated many models, tasks, and RL algorithms and find that present-day RLVR improves Pass@1 but, at larger K, base models catch up. They conclude RLVR has not unlocked fundamentally new reasoning and remains bounded by the base model’s capacity.
A counter from MSR Asia formalized why Pass@K can mask progress and introduce CoT-Pass@K, which requires both a correct answer and a valid chain-of-thought. 
On AIME-2024/2025 with Qwen2.5-32B → DAPO-Qwen-32B, RLVR consistently raises CoT-Pass@K across K, supporting the claim that RLVR implicitly incentivizes correct reasoning paths.
    RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has driven recent progress (OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1) by training on answers that can be automatically checked: math scores, program tests, or exact matches. However, two recent studies disagree on what RLVR actually adds. One argues it mostly reshuffles sampling without creating new reasoning; the other shows gains once you score the reasoning chains themselves rather than just final answers. Together they map where RLVR helps today and where it stalls.

OpenAI: experimental reasoning model reached IMO gold under contest-style conditions (≈35/42, 5/6 problems). Also at the “coding Olympics” (ICPC-style test), GPT-5 solved 12/12 problems (11 on first try). 
DeepMind: after silver in 2024, IMO gold-level performance reported in 2025.
Harmonic (Aristotle): announced formally verified IMO gold-medal-level results and released verification artifacts.
Gödel-Prover (Princeton/Goedel-LM): open-source prover with 57.6% Pass@32 on miniF2F (+7.6 over prior OS SOTA), 7 problems on PutnamBench, and 29.7k new Lean proofs—fuel for the training flywheel. 
These improvements point to the very real possibility of a non-trivial research-level result in mathematics being proven and formalized by an AI system (with some human supervision involved) within the next year.
    Math is a verifiable domain: systems can plan, compute, and check every step, and publish artifacts others can audit. So 2025 saw competitive math and formal proof systems jump together: OpenAI, DeepMind and Harmonic hit IMO gold-medal performance, while auto-formalization and open provers set new records.

    Thinking Machines show that RL can match full fine-tuning even with rank-1 Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In policy-gradient setups, LoRA updates only tiny adapters while the backbone stays frozen, yet it reaches the same peak performance, often with a wider range of stable learning rates. The reason is that RL supplies very few bits per episode, so even tiny adapters have ample capacity to absorb what RL can teach.
With LoRA you insert tiny adapters in a few attention and MLP layers and update only those during PPO, GRPO, or RLHF. The backbone does not change.
This cuts the trainable parameters from billions to millions, so gradients and optimizer state shrink by roughly 10–50×. Memory pressure falls even further when you pair LoRA with 8-bit weights.
Under the same budget you can move from a 7-13B class model to a much larger 30-70B class model. You can also fit longer contexts or larger batches on the same cards.
Very low adapter ranks can, however, underfit. Reasonable choices are ranks in the 16–64 range and placing adapters in the layers that matter for the skill you

From naive retrieval to active selection: Early methods used simple Nearest Neighbor retrieval, often selecting redundant data. New algorithms like ETH Zürich's SIFT now integrate active learning to select small, diverse, and maximally informative examples for each query.
This on-demand learning consistently outperforms in-context learning, especially on complex tasks. It creates a new performance vector independent of pre-training scale. An actively fine-tuned 3.8B Phi-3 model (red bars) can outperform a base 27B Gemma-2 model. Admittedly these models are a little old. 
A recent follow-up, Local Mixtures of Experts (test-time model merging), amortizes TTT by training small neighborhood experts and, at inference, retrieving and merging a few weight deltas into the base model. It keeps most SIFT-style gains with near-retrieval latency and, on ~1B bases, approaches TTT accuracy while running up to ~100× faster. Titans studies test-time memorization as an architectural memory and is orthogonal to amortized TTT.
    The scaling paradigm is shifting from static pre-training to dynamic, on-the-fly adaptation. Test-time fine-tuning (TTT) adapts a model's weights to a specific prompt at inference, a step towards continuous learning.

    Researchers have discovered why merging multiple expert AI models hits a performance wall: the task vector space undergoes rank collapse, causing different experts' knowledge to become redundant rather than complementary. Subspace Boosting uses singular value decomposition to maintain the unique contributions of each model, achieving >10% gains when merging up to 20 specialists. This breakthrough could facilitate versatile systems that combine specialized models without the usual degradation that occurs at scale.

As models are merged using existing methods (task arithmetic, TIES-Merging, etc.), the rank of the task vector space progressively decreases - meaning a 100-dimensional space of possible model behaviors might effectively shrink to just 20-30 dimensions, wasting the potential of additional experts.
Their subspace boosting method operates on the SVD-decomposed task vector space, explicitly preserving the rank by maintaining orthogonal components that represent each expert's unique contributions to the merged model.
They achieved >10% improvement on vision benchmarks including evaluation across multiple datasets when merging large numbers of experts, successfully merging up to 20 expert models with consistent performance gains (whereas traditional methods typically degrade after 5-10).

The Muon Optimizer: expanding the compute-time Pareto frontier beyond AdamW
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Muon requires 10-15% fewer tokens than AdamW at large batch sizes (128K-16M), expanding the compute-time Pareto frontier.
Muon works with maximal update parameterization (muP) and telescoping (a way to progressively refine hyperparameter search across model scales), enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning at O(C log N) cost (where N is model width and C is the cost of training the model).
This could make second-order optimization economically viable. The 10-15% token efficiency gain saves millions at scale, while telescoping muP eliminates the prohibitive hyperparameter search costs that previously made second-order methods impractical.
A recent study on optimizers validates these modest gains: when tested fairly with proper tuning, even the best optimizers (including Muon) achieve ~10% speedups over AdamW at scale. This aligns with Muon's claims and debunks the 2x speedup assertions made by some in the field.

Cut Cross Entropy (CCE) computes the cross-entropy loss by calculating only the logits for correct tokens directly, while evaluating the normalization term over the vocabulary in fast on-chip memory. This makes global memory consumption for the cross-entropy computation negligible.
CCE achieves a remarkable 24 reduction in memory consumption, taking Gemma 2's loss computation from 
24GB down to just 1 MB, while actually running ~5% faster than the best existing methods.
The practical impact of this is that it allows researchers to train models much more efficiently - either using fewer GPUs for the same batch size, or achieving better GPU utilization with larger batches on the same hardware.
Cutting your losses: significant memory reduction for LLM training

On random data, models hit a clear ceiling of ~3.6 bits per parameter, providing an upper bound on raw storage capacity.
On natural text, memorization dominates until capacity is saturated; beyond that, double descent forces generalization to emerge.
Modern frontier-scale LLMs train on vastly more tokens than their capacity, making loss-based membership inference statistically unreliable.
Nevertheless, new extraction and membership inference methods are gaining traction on small-to-medium models, highlighting continued privacy risk.
    There’s a way to separate memorization from generalization, showing that GPT-family models have a finite “capacity” of ~3.6 bits per parameter. Models memorize training data until that capacity is full, then must generalize once dataset size exceeds it. This explains the “double descent” phenomenon and why today’s largest LLMs, trained with extreme data-to-parameter ratios, are difficult to probe for specific memorized examples. At the same time, membership inference attacks are still improving on smaller-scale models.

Post-training mixes supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning, with native tool use, visible reasoning, and adjustable thinking time.

Sora 2 is trained and post-trained on large-scale video so the model keeps track of objects and cause-and-effect over time. Shots link together more coherently, bodies and materials behave more plausibly, and audio is generated in step with the visuals to sell the scene.
Despite being a video model, Sora 2 can “solve” text benchmarks when framed visually. EpochAI tested a small GPQA Diamond sample and Sora 2 reached 55% (vs 72% for GPT-5) by prompting for a video of a professor holding up the answer letter. Four videos were generated per question and any clip without a clear letter was marked wrong. 
A likely explanation is a prompt-rewriting LLM layer that first solves the question and then embeds the solution in the video prompt, similar to re-prompting used in some other video generators.
    OpenAI’s second-gen Sora adds synchronized dialogue and sound, stronger physics, and much tighter control over multi-shot scenes. It can also insert a short “cameo” of a real person with their voice and appearance into generated footage, and launches alongside an invite-only iOS app for creation and remixing.

In OMNI-EPIC, foundation models generate environment and reward code, while the system filters for tasks that are both learnable and useful, maintaining an expanding archive.
In Kinetix, general controllers are trained in a procedurally generated very large-scale task space that transfer to human-designed levels.
In the Darwin Gödel Machine, the agent rewrites its own code, validates changes empirically, and archives only improved variants to produce measurable iteration-over-iteration gains on coding benchmarks (right figures).
    Open endedness describes a learning system that continually proposes and solves new tasks without a fixed endpoint, selecting tasks that are both novel and learnable, and accumulating the resulting skills so they can be reused to reach further, harder tasks. Interactive and persistent world models make this increasingly feasible.

Meta’s MLGym is a gym for AI-research agents with 13 open-ended tasks across vision, language, RL, and game theory. It supports RL training and logs reproducible traces. Early results indicate that most gains come from hyperparameter tuning rather than genuinely new method design.
OpenAI’s PaperBench evaluates replication of 20 ICML 2024 spotlight and oral papers. It decomposes each paper into thousands of graded subtasks. Current agents achieve low replication scores, which highlights a significant gap to human research practice.
Michigan’s EXP-Bench contains 461 tasks derived from 51 top papers. It requires agents to design, implement, run, and analyze complete experiments starting from provided code. End-to-end success is rare while partial component scores are higher.
MLR-Bench offers 201 real research tasks with an LLM reviewer calibrated to expert judgment. It evaluates literature synthesis, experiment execution, and report quality. The authors report reasonable judge alignment and frequent failure modes such as fabrication and invalid runs.

Stanford’s “Virtual Lab” is a principal investigator plus specialist agents that hold “lab meetings,” plan workflows, and integrate protein structure tools (ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, Rosetta). It designed 92 nanobodies including confirmed binders to recent SARS-CoV-2 variants.
DeepMind’s Co-Scientist is a multi-agent system built on Gemini 2.0 that generates, debates, and evolves its approach to hypothesis generation and experimental planning. It was shown to propose drug candidates for AML (blood cancer) and new epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis that were validated in vitro. In a subsequent blind test set by bacteriophage experts, Co-Scientist proposed the tail-hijacking mechanism for cf-PICI transfer that experiments later confirmed. 
    AI is moving from answering questions to generating, testing, and validating new scientific knowledge. New “AI labs” organize coalitions of agent roles (PI, reviewers, experimenters) that ideate, cite, run code, and hand results back to human teams, shortening the loop from hypothesis to validation.

The model is a hierarchical geometric network that encodes atoms, chemical blocks, and whole interfaces, then reconstructs masked structure to learn general interface features.
Using these embeddings, “ATOMICANets” link proteins by interface similarity and recover disease-specific communities such as lipid modules in asthma and ion modules in myeloid leukemia.
The team predicts 2,646 previously unannotated ligand-binding sites and reports wet-lab confirmation of five heme binders, indicating that the representation carries biochemical signal.
    ATOMICA learns an all-atom representation of intermolecular interfaces across proteins, nucleic acids, ions, lipids, and small molecules. It trains with self-supervision on about two million interfaces and builds embeddings that transfer across tasks. The model connects interface physics to disease modules and proposes new ligand-binding sites that hold up in the lab.

UMA is a Mixture of Linear Experts (MoLE) with the largest model reaching 3.7B. It’s trained on DFT calculations of 500M atomistic configurations from OMat24 (118M structures, 400M CPU core-hours), OMat25 (88M structures, 600M CPU core-hours), OMol25 (100M molecules, 6B CPU core-hours), and adsorption datasets.
UMA goes beyond prior models by embedding charge, spin, and task identity, and by ensuring energy-conserving force predictions for long molecular dynamics rollouts.
Across crystal stability (Matbench Discovery), catalysis (OC20), molecules (OMol25), and sorbents (ODAC25), UMA consistently sets the new standard.
    Meta’s FAIR trained UMA, a new family of universal interatomic potentials. These approximate the forces and energies between atoms, a task that usually demands resource-intensive quantum calculations (DFT). By replacing DFT with fast and accurate AI surrogates, UMA makes it possible to simulate materials, molecules, and sorbents at a scale that was previously unimaginable. They also produced the largest materials database.

MatterGen is a diffusion model that learns to refine lattices, element types, and atomic positions into stable crystal structures by independently randomizes atom types, coordinates, and lattices, followed by iteratively denoising them back toward physically plausible structures.
It’s trained on ~600k stable crystal structures of compounds (Materials Project and Alexandria) with adapter modules for chemistry, symmetry, and property control that are fine-tuned into the model. 
MatterGEn generates materials that are 2x more likely to be stable and novel, and 10x closer to equilibrium energy minima vs. SOTA.
It achieved multi-property inverse design (e.g. combining band gap and magnetism) and saw its first lab synthesis succeed, with measured values within ~20% of AI predictions.
    Where UMA shows that scaling data and parameters yields universal predictive models, MatterGen takes the next leap: using diffusion to directly generate new inorganic crystals with targeted properties, rather than screening existing ones.

ChemBench finds frontier models (e.g., o1-preview; open Llama-3.1-405B close behind) outperform the best human chemists on aggregate, with performance rising with model size. Retrieval alone doesn’t fix knowledge-heavy failures.  ￼
The current best approach uses a large LLMs as a strategic evaluator plugged into search (incl. MCTS): it judges routes and mechanisms from natural-language constraints. Newer, larger models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro) lead; strong open options (e.g., DeepSeek-r1) are close.  ￼
This LLM-as-judge + search pattern brings human-like planning (protecting-group timing, ring-formation order) without forcing the LLM to emit SMILES (still challenging) and it scales as LLMs improve, and as inference time increases.
    Chemical modeling has shifted from task-specific predictors to general LLMs that reason about synthesis strategy and mechanisms. The strongest results now come from large, general-purpose transformers used as “reasoning engines” and paired with classical search, rather than chemistry-specific generators. Benchmarks also show these models matching or beating expert chemists on curated Q&A while still missing knowledge-intensive and multi-modal edge cases.

Simple train/test splits exaggerate success as many test cases look like training data and adding more samples per case helps only a bit.
The UK’s OpenBind is building novelty-aware, reproducible protein–ligand benchmarks and open baselines (scaffold/time/pocket splits with physics checks) to measure true out-of-distribution binding and enable reproducible evaluation.
Runs N’ Poses benchmark of 2,600 protein–ligand pairs tested AF3 against open source reproductions. Accuracy rose steadily when the pocket and pose resembled past training cases, and dropped for novel ones. 
To judge models fairly, researchers combined multiple checks: do the right atoms contact each other, does the ligand sit in the right spot, and is the structure physically realistic (no clashes)?
    AlphaFold-3 can predict full multi-molecule complexes, inspiring many open-source reproduction efforts. These systems perform well when the binding site (“pocket”) and the way a molecule fits into it (“pose”) look like examples the models have seen before. But when chemistry is new or different, accuracy falls. This shows that progress often reflects training-set familiarity more than true generalisation.

    Diffusion LLMs generate by iteratively denoising masked sequences with full-context attention, updating many tokens in parallel at each step. Recent systems now reach competitive 7-8B quality, add arbitrary-order generation and infilling, and expose useful quality-latency trade-offs.
LLaDA trains diffusion LMs from scratch using forward masking and reverse denoising with a standard Transformer. It reports competitive general-purpose scores at 8B and extends to a paired vision model (LLaDA-V).
Dream-7B uses arbitrary-order generation and robust infilling with a diffusion decoder. It performs well against similarly sized autoregressive models on reasoning and coding tasks.
Seed Diffusion targets throughput, reaching ~2,146 tok/s on H20-class GPUs while maintaining competitive code accuracy.
LongLLaDA analyzes long-context behavior and introduces a training-free length-extension method, showing stable perplexity under extrapolation and a “local perception” effect.

In controlled scaling studies at the 8B class, BLT reaches quality comparable to tokenized LLMs. It also reduces inference compute at the same quality by growing patch size with model size rather than paying per token.
Byte-level training improves robustness to spelling variation, noise, and long-tail inputs. 
The model reads raw bytes, groups them into patches where next-byte entropy is high, encodes each patch locally, and then lets a Transformer operate over the patch sequence before decoding back to text.
    The Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) learns directly from bytes and uses entropy-driven “patches” as the compute unit. At 8B, BLT matches tokenized LLM quality while opening a new scaling axis and cutting inference FLOPs for the same quality. Follow-on work pushes dynamic chunking and adaptation beyond fixed tokenizers.

The sink acts as a learned brake on mixing: by parking attention on the first position, the model reduces cross-token sensitivity and becomes less reactive to small prompt perturbations; this effect strengthens with longer contexts and larger models.
Training on longer contexts monotonically increases the sink metric. Within the LLaMA-3.1 family, strong sinks are present in ~78% of heads at 405B vs ~46% at 8B.  ￼
In practice, this means the sink attaches to position 1. If ⟨bos⟩ was fixed there during pre-training, removing it at inference collapses performance (e.g., RULER-4096 → 0 and large drops on ARC/HellaSwag). Handle ⟨bos⟩ and packing carefully. 
    Attention is the transformer’s core mechanic. Many heads learn an ‘attention sink’ at the first position that stabilizes computation by throttling over-mixing as depth and context grow. There’s been debate over why models learn this and what it’s for.

Training on Arena data doubles your win rate because 7.3% of prompts get recycled monthly and the test distribution reflects what developers like to ask about (dozens of Star Trek questions, zero on Chaucer).
The company has raised a whopping $100M at a $600M valuation. 
The field requires contamination audits to help alleviate potentially systemic test-train leakage.
OpenAI and Google are hoovering up 40% of all Arena data while 83 open models fight over 30% of the scraps.
Big Tech gets 68 times more data access than academic labs, with API-hosted models seeing every test prompt while third-party models only glimpse 20%.

The trouble with benchmarks: safety-washing
 	71% of safety benchmark variance is explained by general capabilities alone, while genuine risks like WMDP bioweapons (-0.91) worsen as models get smarter.
 
Safety benchmarks are highly correlated with capabilities: simply scaling models improves most safety metrics!
Yet critical safety issues worsen with scale: the most dangerous capabilities are inversely correlated with reported safety improvements
Instruction tuning masks rather than solves problems. Base model correlations flip from negative to positive after chat tuning (CyberSecEval: -0.25 → 0.55) while harmful capabilities remain latent in the model
Safety research should prioritise metrics which are not highly correlated with scale!

LLMs are professional yes-men, and we trained them to be that way
    "Sycophancy" isn't a bug, it's exactly what human feedback optimisation produces. A study of five major LLMs shows they consistently tell users what they want to hear rather than the truth.
Claude 1.3 apologises for being correct 98% of the time when users challenge it with "Are you sure?", even when highly confident in the right answer.
Human crowd-workers are part of the problem, since they also prefer well-written falsehoods when they can't fact-check. The harder the topic, the more they reward confident nonsense.
Best-of-N sampling with standard preference models consistently produces more sycophantic outputs than with truth-optimized preference models.
Standard RLHF has a fundamental flaw – models learn that agreeing with raters > truth because that's literally what the training signal rewards.

35 Spanish-speaking participants memorised sentences, then typed them “blind” on a keyboard. Their brain activity was recorded using either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG).
Brain2Qwerty has three-stages: a CNN analyses input from hundreds of sensors, a transformer refines predictions using sentence context, and a Spanish language model fixes obvious errors. 
    Meta AI researchers developed Brain2Qwerty, a system that decodes what people are typing by reading brain signals from outside the skull, achieving a 19% character error rate for the best participants. This is a substantial improvement on previous non-invasive approaches (but is still far from clinical viability).

Brain-to-text decoding: decoding brain activity during typing

While an average error rate of 32% remains far from invasive Brain Computer Interfaces (<6% CER), down the line this kind of work could have applications in restoring communication for individuals with speech impairments, and contributes to understanding the neural basis of language.
The system's errors show it's tracking finger movements rather than understanding language: when it mistakes a letter, it picks physically adjacent keys 73% of the time.

fMRI (8 subjects, ~10,000 images each, for high-res spatial maps of cortical activity) and MEG (4 subjects, ~22,500 images each, for high-res temporal dynamics) recordings were compared against DINOv3 activations.
Three metrics of brain-model similarity were assessed: encoding score (linear similarity), spatial score (layer ↔ cortical hierarchy), and temporal score (layer ↔ brain response timing.
Brain-like representations emerge progressively during training. Early visual regions and fast MEG responses align quickly, while prefrontal cortices and late temporal windows require far more training, closely echoing the developmental trajectory of the human cortex.
    By systematically varying model size, training scale, and image type in DINOv3 (Meta’s latest self-supervised image model trained on billions of images), researchers show that brain-model convergence emerges in a specific sequence. They find that early layers align with sensory cortices, while only prolonged training and human-centric data drive alignment with prefrontal regions. Larger models converge faster, and later-emerging representations mirror cortical properties like expansion, thickness, and slow timescales.

Cost model (rough estimates): ~$263/hr EEG, $550/hr MEG, $935/hr 3T, $1,093/hr 7T. A $131k budget buys markedly different accuracy across modalities, so optimal scaling depends on budget and target fidelity.
The most precise devices yield the best absolute decoding (7T > 3T > MEG > EEG), but deep nets deliver the largest gains on noisy modalities, narrowing the gap.
Scaling laws: performance rises log-linearly with more recording time. The returns come chiefly from recording more per subject, not recruiting more participants. 
    Meta AI benchmarked brain-to-image decoding across EEG, MEG, 3T fMRI and 7T fMRI using 8 public datasets, 84 volunteers, 498 hours of recordings, and 2.3M image-evoked responses, evaluated in single-trial settings. They find no performance plateau: decoding improves roughly log-linearly with more recording, and gains depend mostly on data per subject rather than adding subjects. Deep learning helps most on the noisiest sensors (EEG/MEG). Estimated dollar-per-hour costs show 7T isn’t always the most cost-effective path.  ￼  ￼

ATOKEN is a single visual tokenizer that maps images, video, and 3D inputs into a shared 4D sparse latent using a pure-Transformer with 4D RoPE. It then emits continuous or discrete tokens, and trains stably with perceptual + Gram losses (no GANs).
One backend now supports both high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding. A curriculum from images → video → 3D shows cross-modal transfer, and native-resolution/time processing with KV caching keeps it scalable (trained up to 256×H100, ~138k GPU-hours).
Specialists approaches still lead on some long-video and generative benchmarks, and the compute bill is high. Adoption will hinge on release details and tooling, but the unified-tokenizer direction looks like the right foundation.
    Apple introduced a single tokenizer that works for both high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, video, and 3D could be the foundation layer for truly unified multimodal models. This approach reduces fragmentation, simplifying stacks, and enabling direct transfer of capabilities across modalities.

    The new generation of robotic agents is built on a foundation of large-scale pre-training, but the key innovation is a move away from expensive, annotated datasets.

Merging the virtual and physical worlds: pre-training on unstructured reality
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
NVIDIA’s GR00T 1.5 represents a significant advance in data efficiency. It uses neural rendering techniques to construct implicit 3D scene representations directly from unstructured 2D videos. This allows it to generate a massive stream of training data for its policy, effectively learning from observation sin humans.
ByteDance’s GR-3 applies the next-token prediction paradigm to robotics. By treating vision, language, and action as a unified sequence, they can pre-train end-to-end. This approach is proving particularly effective when using 2D spatial outputs (e.g., action heatmaps) as an auxiliary loss, helping to ground the model's understanding of physical space.

The case for insulation: Pi-0.5 freezes the large VLM and fine-tunes only small “action-expert” heads. This works because robot datasets are tiny, often ≤0.1% the size of the VLM pre-training corpora, so full-network tuning tends to overfit and forget general knowledge while costing more compute.
The case for end-to-end: In contrast, models like ByteDance GR-3 and SmoLVLA show the upside of unfreezing when you have enough task data: the network can internalize contact, dynamics, and scene geometry. If robotics data approached VLM scale, end-to-end would likely dominate.
    With powerful, pre-trained Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAMs) serving as the "brains" of robotic agents, a critical architectural debate has emerged: should the entire model be fine-tuned for a new physical task, or should the core knowledge be "insulated" by freezing its weights?

    The “Chain-of-Action” pattern - explicit intermediate plans before low-level control - is becoming a standard for embodied reasoning. First shown by AI2’s Molmo-Act in 2025, and rapidly adopted by Gemini Robotics 1.5, this approach mirrors Chain-of-Thought in LLMs, boosting both interpretability and long-horizon reliability in real-world robotics.
Teaching LLMs to Plan (MIT): Parallel work in language introduces explicit plan tokens before final answers, improving long-horizon reliability and giving auditors something to inspect, an LLM analogue of Chain-of-Action.
Molmo-Act (AI2). From a high-level command, the model emits intermediate visual/geometry artifacts (e.g., depth/trajectory sketches) that a separate decoder turns into continuous motor commands. It makes behavior easier to inspect and debug complex manipulation tasks such as pick-and-place or dishwasher loading.
Gemini Robotics 1.5 (GDM): Uses the same plan-then-act architecture with ER 1.5 (the high-level planner) generating structured action plans for Robotics 1.5 to executes via a visuomotor policy.

    Waymo’s EMMA is an end-to-end multimodal model that reimagines autonomous driving as a vision-language problem. By mapping camera inputs directly to driving-specific outputs (such as trajectories and road graph elements) and representing them in natural language, EMMA leverages the reasoning and world knowledge of LLMs to achieve SOTA results while offering human-readable rationales.

 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
EMMA achieves high performance on public datasets such as nuScenes and the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, particularly excelling in motion planning and 3D object detection using camera inputs alone. 
A key feature is its CoT reasoning, which enhances decision-making transparency by prompting the model to explain its decisions sequentially, integrating world 
knowledge. This approach produces outputs such as future vehicle trajectories and object detection estimates in a readable, interpretable format.
Although promising, EMMA is limited by only processing a few frames at a time, not using accurate 3D sensing modalities like LiDAR, and being computationally expensive.

ByteDance’s UI-TARS-2 is a native GUI agent trained by collecting trajectories, running supervised fine-tuning followed by multi-turn RL in an all-in-one sandbox (cloud VMs + browser game env + terminal/SDK tools) with async rollouts and the ability to merge specialized agents.
The system sets SOTA across GUI agent benchmarks: 47.5% OSWorld, 50.6% WindowsAgentArena, 73.3% AndroidWorld, 88.2% Online-Mind2Web, and a 59.8 mean normalized score on 15 web games (~60% of human), beating OpenAI CUA and Claude Computer Use by large margins. It also shows strong inference-time scaling (more steps leads to higher scores).  ￼
But long-horizon problems remain brittle (e.g., Tetris/Sokoban and hard BrowseComp tasks), and average game skill is ~40% shy of human.
    Research labs like OpenAI, Anthropic, and ByteDance have been hard at work creating benchmarks and interaction methods for native language model computer use. While the use of RL and multi step reasoning has led to large improvements by and large the models still fall short.

One can use a “small-first, escalate if needed” design: route routine calls to an SLM and escalate only the hard, open-ended ones to a big LLM. In practice, this can shift 40-70% of calls to small models with no quality loss.
But SLMs still struggle with long context, novel reasoning, or messy conversation. Keep an escape hatch to a large model and evaluate regularly.
Agents mostly fill forms, call APIs, follow schemas, and write short code. New small models (1–9B) do these jobs well: Phi-3-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B handle instructions and tools competitively.
A ~7B model is typically 10-30x cheaper to run and responds faster. You can fine-tune it overnight with LoRA/QLoRA and even run it on a single GPU or device.
    Researchers from NVIDIA and Georgia Tech argue that most agent workflows are narrow, repetitive, and format-bound, so small language models (SLMs) are often sufficient, more operationally suitable, and much cheaper. They recommend SLM-first, heterogeneous agents that invoke large models only when needed.

Sakana’s agent iteratively translated and “optimized” CUDA kernels and internal runs showed 2–7× gains with isolated cases near 100×. Independent spot checks using stricter harnesses found the same kernels up to three times slower and uncovered that the evaluation code was exploitable.
Other labs posted similarly inflated kernel results that collapsed under community spot checks. Practitioners on X routinely sanity-check claims against vendor libraries, roofline bounds, realistic batch sizes, and end-to-end runtime.
    Macro-level benchmark scores and spectacular speedup numbers are often misleading. Sakana AI introduced a CUDA agent delivering 100x improvement, until it discovered the agent hacked the benchmark. Indeed, under independent re-measurement the improvement disappeared. Seasoned GPU engineers would have flagged a 100× kernel gain as implausible, so evaluations should be co-designed and audited with domain experts.

Early incidents (e.g. a malicious Postmark MCP server version on npm silently BCC’d users’ emails to an attacker until it was pulled) show why governance and package hygiene matter.
MCP offers one integration across clients (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude/VS Code, LangChain, Vercel), collapsing one-off connectors and enabling tool discovery, resources and prompts over a common spec. 
Data from Zeta Alpha shows that the MCP protocol has been cited in 3x more research papers than Google’s competing A2A protocol (right graph).
Security researchers estimate >15,000 MCP servers globally. Companies like Microsoft and Vercel are building guardrails and registries as the ecosystem matures. 
    Introduced by Anthropic in late 2024, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has quickly become the default way to plug models into data, tools and apps. In 2025 the big platforms moved to adopt it: OpenAI shipped MCP across ChatGPT, its Agents SDK and API; Google added MCP to Gemini; Microsoft built MCP into VS Code and began rolling it into Windows and Android Studio. With thousands of MCP servers now in the wild, the protocol is shaping how agentic systems are built and secured.

    A leading cohort of 16 AI-first companies are now generating $18.5B of annualized revenue as of Aug ‘25 (left). Meanwhile, an a16z dataset suggests that the median enterprise and consumer AI apps now reach more than $2M ARR and $4M ARR in year one, respectively. Note that this will feature significant sample bias, as evidenced by the bottom quartile not being close to $0. Furthermore, the Lean AI Leaderboard of 44 AI-first companies with more than $5M ARR, <50 FTE, and under five years old (e.g. includes Midjourney, Surge, Cursor, Mercor, Lovable, etc) sums over $4B revenue with an average of >$2.5M revenue/employee and 22 employees/co.

    Analysis of the 100 fastest revenue growing AI companies on Stripe (AI 100) reveals that, as a group, they are growing from launch to $5M ARR at a 1.5x faster rate than the top 100 SaaS companies by revenue in 2018 (SaaS 100). Within the AI 100, the growth rates between US and European companies are roughly equivalent, whereas companies founded in/after 2022 are growing to $5M ARR 4.5x faster than those founded before 2020 and 1.5x faster than those founded after 2022, which exemplifies the commercial pull of generative AI products. Note that we don’t know the total population size of companies from which these were sampled.

The duality of GPT-5: today’s best model was clouded by the worst launch
    GPT-5 leads the intelligence-per-dollar frontier with best-in-class benchmarks at 12x lower cost than Claude, but user backlash over the sudden removal of GPT-4o and o3 and concerns/teething problems about opaque router decisions that users aren’t used to overshadowed its technical achievements. 
GPT-5 is ostensibly a brilliant model: it swept the leaderboard on LMArena and has a 400K context window in the API. OpenAI now dominates the intelligence per dollar frontier for the first time.
The rollout wasn’t ideal: Altman held an emergency Reddit AMA to address the abrupt removal of previous models and viral ‘chart crimes’.
The removal of GPT-4o and o3's familiar personality upset users, which was ironic given the same launch introduced custom personas.
We’ve previously hypothesised that model companies would dynamically route queries to right-sized models for latency and cost reasons. GPT-5 is the first major chat system to introduce this using a router as the consumer endpoint. Users can opt for faster responses by hitting “skip” if the model invokes its more capable version. In practice, people will take time to acclimate to this UX: the perceived opacity of model selection has led to a flurry of complaints.

Leading AI providers continue to record extraordinary demand at inference time 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    As Google flipped the switch on enabling Gemini features within an increasing number of its properties and toggling more users into their AI search experience, the company reported a yearly 50x increase in monthly tokens processed, recently hitting a quadrillion tokens processed each month. Meanwhile, OpenAI reported similar growth in token volume last year.
The demand for tokens has been largely supercharged by improved latency, falling inference prices, reasoning models, longer user interactions, and a growing suite of AI applications. Enterprise adoption has also continued to pick up in 2025. 
Surging inference demand will place additional pressure on AI supply chains, particularly power infrastructure.  
But given that all tokens are not created equal, we’d caution against deriving too much signal from aggregate token processing figures.

Some users are costing upwards of 50k/month for a single seat of Claude Code. Cursor and Claude have introduced much stricter usage limits to try to crack down on the costs of power users.
Cursor’s pricing power is limited because its core COGS are the API prices of Anthropic/OpenAI. When those providers change prices, rate limits, or model defaults, Cursor’s gross margin compresses unless it caps usage or shifts workloads off upstream APIs.

    Gross margins are generally commanded by the underlying model API and inference costs and strained by token-heavy usage and traffic acquisition. Surprisingly, several major AI companies don’t include the costs of running their service for non-paying users when reporting their GM. Coding agents are under pressure even when revenue grows quickly. The primary levers to improve margins are moving off third-party APIs to owned or fine-tuned models, aggressive caching and retrieval efficiency, and looking to ads or outcomes-based pricing.

AI labs mirror the foundry business: staggering investments are needed for each successive generation, where labs bear the front-loaded training expense. While recent models allegedly recoup this cost during deployment, training budgets surge. Pressure then mounts to drive inference revenue across new streams.
    Dario Amodei: “If every model was a company, the model—in this example—is actually profitable.” Despite high burn rates, speculation indicates many of the frontier labs enjoy strong unit economics on a flagship model basis.
Inference pays for training: labs strive to allocate more of a model’s lifecycle compute to revenue-generating inference at the steepest margin possible. Our table* below illustrates the expected return on compute costs across varying inference margins and compute allocations.    
*Simplified sensitivity analysis: neglects people costs and assumes all inference generates revenue. Can also be interpreted in terms of token count between inference & training (2DN vs. 6DN, MFU: ~15% vs. ~45%).

ChatGPT Search offers real-time web results by searching Google and a new Agent that spins up a virtual browser to execute multi-step tasks via tool use within ChatGPT with user control. It’s also rumored to be launching a standalone browser. 
Taking another route, Perplexity built their own Chrome-based browser, Comet, with a native AI assistant sidebar. It can perform Q&A but also complete multi-step tasks in the browser (filling forms, scraping), again with user oversight.
Anthropic and Google released limited previews of Claude for Chrome and Gemini in Chrome, respectively, that also let users operate the browser and access Q&A functionality. Anthropic no longer deems this use case to be dangerous. 
In Sept ‘25, Atlassian acquired The Browser Company (makers of Arc) further reaffirming that browsers are the latest AI battleground.
    Users live in the browser, so why shouldn’t AI be baked into the experience? This is finally happening. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and Perplexity all launched assistants that not only unlock Q&A with web content but also navigate and act within the browser on behalf of the user. This shift reframes the browser as an intelligent operating system for the internet, a long sought vision that earlier attempts like Adept AI never fully realized.

By August 2025, ChatGPT served 755M monthly users, giving it ~60% of the AI search market.
SEM Rush data shows Google’s global search traffic fell ~7.9% year-over-year, the first significant dip in decades, even as it retained ~90% global share. Similarweb data shows Google search visits down 1-3% YoY throughout H1 2025, with Bing (-18%) and DuckDuckGo (-11%) also declining.
Perplexity queries hit 780M in May 2025, growing 20% month-over-month, as citation-rich answers drew loyal users.
“ChatGPT” itself became a top Google search term with 618M monthly queries, rivaling “Facebook”.
    With 700M weekly active users, ChatGPT is evangelising AI-powered search to the masses, reshaping how people discover and use information. Google’s once unshakeable dominance shows the first signs of erosion, even as they pivot to AI Overviews (AIO) and AI Mode within Google Search. Moreover, AIO has driven a ~90% drop in Search click-throughs, harming traditional ads, but ignores users being influenced by the AI answers.

    According to Similar Web data, retail visits referred by ChatGPT now convert better than every major marketing channel measured. Conversion rates rose roughly 5pp YoY, from ~6% (Jun ’24) to ~11% (Jun ’25). Although AI referrals are still a smaller slice of traffic, they arrive more decided and closer to purchase. Retailers must adapt by exposing structured product data, price and delivery options, and landing pages tailored to AI-driven intents.

In an average session, users send ~5 prompts and receive ~5 responses, far more interaction than a typical search query, scroll, and blue-link click.
Profound data shows ChatGPT users average 5.6 turns per session, versus ~4 for Gemini and Perplexity, and ~3.9 for DeepSeek. Either more turns means more engaging conversations, or fewer turns means answers are given more efficiently. 
Conversation styles differ: DeepSeek users write the longest prompts and get the most verbose answers, while Perplexity delivers shorter, citation-heavy responses.
This iterative style and memory capability makes answer engines “sticky” and explains why they already deliver higher conversion rates than Google.
Profound’s analysis shows ChatGPT’s crawler is now among the top 10 most active bots on the internet, alongside Googlebot and Bingbot.
    Data from answer engine optimization company Profound shows that users treat AI answer engines differently from Google. Sessions are longer, with more back-and-forth, suggesting higher intent and better conversion potential. Answer engines are no longer just a curiosity - they’re a primary entry point for serious queries.

Answer engines drive deeper engagement than search
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Source: Profound data

Profound data shows GPT-5’s citations matched 19% of Google domains when compared against the top 10 Google results, underscoring both reliance on Google’s index and a broader sourcing pattern.
Avg citation position also shifted down the page, while the median stayed at #9, meaning that ChatGPT is just as likely to surface content further down Google’s results page. 
ChatGPT often pulls from lower-ranked pages than humans typically click, widening exposure for sites beyond the top results.
Top domains cited across models: Reddit (3.5%), Wikipedia (1.7%), YouTube (1.5%), and Forbes (1.0%).
Different models show sourcing styles: Gemini and Perplexity lean toward mainstream concise sources, while DeepSeek tends to draw on long-form domains.
This means optimizing for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is as important as SEO because visibility depends not just on rank, but on model citation patterns.
    Understanding how AI answer engines cite and retrieve information is critical for visibility on AI-first web. Profound’s analysis shows ChatGPT draws heavily from Google’s index but distributes attention differently across the web, with lower-ranked pages often getting visibility. This behavior changes with new model versions too.

Fair p(l)ay out 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
This does not set legal precedent as the case did not go to trial, but is a very significant development in the ongoing fair use debate. Since this was an “opt-out” class action, authors who are eligible can request exclusion to file independent lawsuits. Anthropic also agreed to delete works that had been downloaded. 
🤑
In June, a judge sided with Anthropic, ruling that training LLMs on legally purchased books was sufficiently transformative to constitute fair use. He also ruled that training on pirated copies was illegal. Previously Anthropic had hired Tom Turvey, the former head of Google Books, who mass bought physical books and then created digital copies that were used for model training. 
During a deposition, co-founder of Anthropic Ben Mann testified to having downloaded the LibGen dataset (which contains pirated material) when he previously worked at OpenAI…

Welcome to the Stargate: may the FLOPS be with you
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    10 years ago, Baidu, Google and others had shown early scaling laws whereby deep learning models for speech and image recognition converged faster as more GPUs were used for training. Back then, this meant using up to 128 GPUs. In January this year, Sam Alman, Masayoshi Son, Larry Ellison and President Trump announced the Stargate Project, a gigantic 10GW-worth of GPU capacity to be built with $500B in the US over 4 years. This equates to over 4 million chips! The buildout is to be funded by SoftBank, MGX, Oracle, and OpenAI.

Broadcom’s great transformation
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Broadcom's 2013 LSI acquisition included a small custom chip unit that now designs Google TPUs and Meta's AI chips, growing from <20% of LSI's revenue at acquisition to $2-3B+ annually.
Broadcom's stock price has surged, signaling investor optimism about the company's ability to benefit from the rapidly growing AI chip market.
    Once an unglamorous semiconductor firm, Broadcom has now positioned itself at the cutting edge of the AI revolution through its custom chip partnerships with Google, Meta, and reportedly OpenAI. The development of custom AI chips like Amazon's Trainium and Broadcom’s TPUs / MTIA chips gives frontier labs more leverage when negotiating multi-billion dollar deals with NVIDIA.
Broadcom's AI chip revenue reached $5.2B in Q3 2025, up 63% year-over-year.
The custom chip ecosystem puts pressure on NVIDIA's monopoly: Amazon's in-house Trainium chips and Broadcom-powered alternatives (Google TPUs, Meta MTIA, OpenAI's upcoming chips) give hyperscalers multiple paths to reduce NVIDIA dependence, if they’re willing to endure the user pain.

OpenAI and its benefactor, Microsoft, navigate a rocky relationship
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    OpenAI’s recent restructuring and soaring demand for training compute has placed tremendous stress on its relationship with Microsoft. While signs of fracturing become noticeable, a complete divorce looks unlikely. 

"We are below them,  above them, around them."
Microsoft’s inability, or unwillingness, to bring training compute online fast enough has impacted OpenAI’s roadmap. As OpenAI has gravitated closer to Oracle to fulfill these needs, Microsoft has abstained from exercising its “right of first refusal.” They appear hesitant to bet on next-generation centralized clusters. 
Meanwhile, OpenAI appears to be trying to escape from other key elements of their partnership with Microsoft. Through 2030, Microsoft maintains a 20% revenue sharing arrangement, access to OpenAI’s IP, and exclusivity on OpenAI’s API. Yet, OpenAI wants the 20% share dialed back to 10% before the end of the decade. 
Microsoft can always work to block the for-profit’s conversion into a PBC, which could cost OpenAI $20B in funding if not completed by the end of 2025. Conversely, OpenAI always retains the option to air antitrust concerns if Microsoft proves adversarial or reneges on certain AGI clauses. 
Microsoft AI also released previews of a voice and MoE model trained on 15k H100s.

Oracle steps up as a key buildout partner for AI infra
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    As Microsoft has dialed back its willingness to shoulder so much of the future AI infra buildout, Oracle has begun picking up slack. During the early phase of this shift, Oracle has been rewarded as its stock soars.

OpenAI has reached a $30B per year agreement with Oracle for data center services. This deal more than doubled Oracle’s collective fiscal 2025 cloud service revenue, when it sold just $24.5B worth of services. 

This news comes as OpenAI’s deal with Softbank begins to fray. Recently, original Stargate Project plans were scaled-back, tempering those roadmaps. 
Oracle now fills this vacuum, proving to have found the risk-appetite and follow-through that both Microsoft and SoftBank seem to lack. As a consequence, Oracle’s stock has jumped more than >70% year to date.
Oracle’s current track is not without major risks. Providing large-scale clusters has not been exceptionally high-return, particularly as power bottlenecks are costly to overcome. AI lab tightness could eventually raise issues for longer leases. Finally, depreciation cliffs present concerns and the economics of converting these clusters to inference fleets remains murky. More decentralized builds could then win out, especially if scaling continues to shift to RL.

AI labs target 2028 to bring online 5GW scale training clusters  
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    Anthropic shared expectations that training models at the frontier will require data centers with 5GW capacity by 2028, in line with the roadmaps of other labs. The feasibility of such endeavors will depend on many factors:

How much generation can hyperscalers bring behind-the-meter? At such scale, islanding will likely not be practical, requiring data centers to tap into grid assets.
How quickly can players navigate the morass of permitting and interconnection? While reforms are underway, connection timelines for projects of this magnitude can take many years. Hyperscalers may skip queues through lobbying efforts and demand response programs, where they curtail draw during peak periods (a recent Duke study projects 76GW of new availability with curtailment rates at 0.25%). 
What level of decentralization can be achieved? Many labs continue to pursue single-site campuses, yet distributed approaches are also advancing rapidly. 
How well can hyperscalers navigate talent and supply chain shortages? Attempts to alleviate power infrastructure and skilled labor bottlenecks through the massive mobilizations of capital can overload the risk-appetite of supporting parties.

Shortfall forecasts spike and consequences loom around the corner 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    NERC reported that electricity shortages could occur within the next 1-3 years in several major US regions. DOE warns blackouts could be 100 times more frequent by 2030 due to unreliability and new AI demand.
Similarly, SemiAnalysis projects a 68 GW implied shortfall by 2028 if forecasted AI data center demand fully materializes in the US. 
As an emerging pattern, this will force firms to increasingly offshore the development of AI infrastructure. Since many of the US’ closest allies also struggle with electric power availability, America will be forced to look toward other partnerships – highlighted by recent deals in the Middle East. 
Projects that are realized on American soil will place further strain on the US’ aging grid. Supply-side bottlenecks and rapid spikes in AI demand threaten to induce outages and surges in electricity prices. ICF projects residential retail rates could increase up to 40% by 2030. These factors could further contribute to the public backlash directed at frontier AI initiatives in the US.

Could data centers ever truly be green?
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    The widespread AI buildout places data center emissions on a steeper trajectory, while creative carbon accounting techniques continue to understate the true emissions associated with many hyperscalers.
Data center-related emissions could surge as more providers island with natural gas plants and grid operators recommission or delay the retirement of existing coal plants.
As AI factories are ultimately offshored to other regions, the carbon intensity of those locations is likely to be much higher than that of the US, requiring cloud providers to pursue more aggressive procurements of carbon offsets.
Deceptive carbon accounting practices are also prominent. Some hyperscalers omit upstream categories, such as the emissions associated with manufacturing IT equipment and constructing or maintaining the relevant power plants. Furthermore, additionality agreements can cover new renewable projects that were already planned to commence.

Just how thirsty are AI factories? 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    AI factories withdraw considerable amounts of water and are more likely to be built in high water-stress areas. Still, the Water Usage Efficiency (WUE) of most AI factories are trending in a favorable direction.   
An average 100 MW hyperscale data center in the US consumes roughly 2M Liters per day, mostly due to the indirect toll associated with power generation. Yet, as modern AI data centers shift to closed-loop liquid cooling solutions, their WUE plummets relative to other traditional data centers. 
However, second-order costs cannot be ignored as the number of new AI factories continues to surge, leading to more generation coming online. In the US, this creates a geographic mismatch: the sites where power is available or can be easily built often sit in drier climates with water stress. This trend may be exacerbated by the shift to water-intensive generation sources – particularly nuclear, coal, & certain natgas plants. 
Currently, everyday AI usage carries negligible impacts – a typical Gemini app text prompt consumes only 0.26 mL of water (~5 drops). Yet, WUE must be monitored as AI interactions continue to use more tokens.

 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    Google’s commitment signals demand for an energy source that will not be deployment-ready until early next decade, kicking off a new wave of investment.
While support for next-generation energy sources holds strong, fusion remains many years away from providing a scalable solution to AI’s demand for power. AI’s energy footprint traces a very steep curve, yet the timelines of next-generation sources are not compressing.

Chinese labs have yet to advance the frontier, but compete in the open-weight domain
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    Chinese labs like Alibaba, DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax continue to release impressive open-weight models. A capability gap emerges between these models and most American open-source alternatives. 
US open model efforts have disappointed. OpenAI’s open-weight models underwhelmed with performance trailing far behind GPT-5. 
The restructuring of Meta’s “Superintelligence” team has cast doubts on their commitment to open-sourcing at the frontier. Other teams like Ai2 lag far behind in terms of funding. Although they recently landed $152M from NVIDIA and NSF, that figure pales in comparison to even OpenAI’s initial grant from 2015.
Conversely, Chinese organizations continue to push the envelope, while publishing troves of new algorithmic efficiency gains.

…yet is this an overt strategy or a side-effect of China’s inability to scratch the frontier
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    China’s commitment to the open-source community could be a lasting tactic or a short-term play exercised to reach frontier-level capabilities. It has already proven an effective method in catching-up to the pack. 

While open-source projects can successfully build mind-share, competitive realities exist. Proprietary options make greater commercial sense once a lead has been established, easing the generation of returns and protecting algorithmic unlocks. 
Yet, China’s recent AI Action Plan did include an entire section dedicated to upholding the responsibility of “[building] transnational open source communities and safe and reliable open source platforms.” This theme has been a familiar theme in other messaging produced by the CCP. 
Other Chinese AI leaders, such as Liang Wenfeng, have grown invested in open source culture, viewing their contributions as a means of earning global recognition and “respect.”

Flip-Flop: new chip restrictions imposed then dropped…but has the damage been done?
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    BIS originally sent letters to NVIDIA & AMD announcing the requirement of licenses for the sale of H20 & MI308 chips to China, effectively halting sales. Months later, the Trump administration walked back these controls. 
The CCP immediately denied claims that this concession was linked to ongoing trade negotiations, sparking speculation the move was instead intended to contain Chinese chipmakers such as Huawei. Others view this pivot as an attempt to ensure NVIDIA plays ball amid location verification initiatives like the Secure Chip Act. 
NVIDIA welcomed this shift, announcing its plan to fulfill existing orders. However, Chinese CSP’s have canceled these purchases and the production of H20 line recently halted. Instead, NVIDIA await directives from both countries in its hopes to launch a B30A line, based on the Blackwell architecture. 
Due to strategic interdependencies, attempts to deepen China’s dependence on the American AI accelerator ecosystem carries tradeoffs at the model layer. In this scenario, Chinese labs can continue to tap into high bandwidth compute, improving their ability to both serve customers and develop RL-heavy reasoning models. Although smuggling appears inevitable, export decisions represent a swinging pendulum between these two layers of the stack.

China’s internet regulator CAC, state planner NDRC, and industry ministry MIIT told large platforms to halt new H20 orders and urged avoiding all NVIDIA chips, pushing inference to local parts.

    After U.S. export flip-flops and Lutnick remarking that “You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack, that’s the thinking,” Beijing pivoted from mitigation to home-grown substitution. Regulators steered demand off NVIDIA while fabs and suppliers scaled domestic options.

Rampant smuggling also shifts export control calculus
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    During the temporary H20 ban, $1B worth of NVIDIA chips were smuggled to China. Markups are rumoured to float around 50%, relatively low for black-market products, suggesting a deep supply of diverted GPUs in China. 
Similarly, NVIDIA, who long maintained a stance denying any evidence of diversions, finally recognized ongoing smuggling. NVIDIA framed such activity as a “losing proposition,” since they only provide service for authorized data center products. Steps to prevent future diversions are technically feasible through location-based attestation firmware, yet these mitigations are not completely bulletproof.
Smuggling patterns appeared to intensify during the ban, with a sharp drop off following the reversal. Based on this relationship, Chinese AI efforts seem to prefer defanged NVIDIA chips over domestic offerings and smuggled GPUs, which carry markups, compliance risks, and lacking support. Sliding-scale restrictions could work to weaken China’s smuggling muscle, directing more SOTA chips to the West.

Assessing the current pros and cons of modern chip export controls
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

Worse options can stunt AI investment. There is already a 10:1 AI capex gap between the US & China.
Fewer aggregate flops blocks adoption by cutting off the number of agents and assistants available.
Frees up capacity for American AI efforts.
Destroys the bridge available to adversaries as they continue to pursue self-reliance.
Dries up the resources available to adversaries for AI-related military-civil fusion projects.
Gatekeeping offers government revenue streams.
Cutting off supply introduces constraints that makes     it harder for adversaries to export their stack. 


Developers that are forced off the American stack then bolster foreign software ecosystems. 
Lost cash flow can cause a drag on US R&D/M&A,  while supporting the spend of foreign competitors.
Stricter controls incentivize smuggling operations.
Controls can indiscriminately block the benefits of AI diffusion, provoking retaliation (e.g. REE controls).
Enforcement challenges can strain relationships with nations where channels for diversion exist. 
Enacting defensive measures, like location-based guardrails, could make foreign options more attractive if overreach is suspected.

AI supercomputer supremacy: US domination and corporate concentration
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    The US controls ~75% of global AI supercomputer capacity with 850,000 H100-equivalents compared to China's 110,000. What’s more, the concentration of compute power has shifted from public to private hands, with companies now controlling 80% of AI supercomputers (up from 40% in 2019). Despite this massive compute advantage and export controls, China is consistently shipping very capable open weight models - more frequently and across the spectrum of modalities. 
US computational performance is 9x China's and 17x the EU's. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where compute advantage drives breakthroughs that attract more investment.
By 2030, the leading AI supercomputer could require 2 million chips, $200 billion, and 9 GW of power (equivalent to nine nuclear reactors), making power grid capacity rather than chips or capital the likely binding constraint.
The 40% → 80% private sector shift limits academic compute access and reduces government visibility into AI development, as companies can afford $7B systems while government projects max out at $600M, creating both a research bottleneck and a policy blindspot.

Racing toward indigenous semiconductor capacity
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Thus far, SME export controls appear to have proven effective at slowing Chinese capabilities. Expectations remain that SMIC will launch full-scale 5nm operations early next year, yet yields are unlikely to reach the levels of other industry leaders. Furthermore, this limited capacity must also be spread across a wide base of other consumer products – such as cell phones and laptops. 
TSMC Fab 21 Phase 1 has worked to onshore critical capacity back to the United States. While AMD will direct some of this capacity toward the production of its AI chips, advanced packaging will still be performed in Taiwan. The US remains years away from self-sufficiency.
Taiwan cruises ahead, while also maintaining capacity at many processes behind its own domestic leading-edge. Yet, much of that capacity will continue to be rapidly converted to 2nm and 3nm.
    Taiwan continues to reign supreme in terms of leading-edge manufacturing capacity, maintaining massive advantages in both generation and volume.

    Without sufficient electricity, national AI plans will collapse. A summary of the previous slide can be found below:

Power Plays: China and the United States
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
In 2024, both China and the US set records for peak electricity demand, 1,450 GW and 759 GW respectively. While China must serve more demand, it is also building a larger overhang of available power. In China, reserve margins are beginning to exceed those cited in the US, meaning larger buffers that can accommodate new load. In line with this trend, China’s thermal fleet operates further below maximum capacity than its counterpart in the US. Similarly, as more renewable capacity comes online in China, curtailment rates outpace those in America. While congestion can cause issues, it also suggests Chinese solar and wind projects are underutilized and could be redirected toward new data centers. 
The US does maintain certain advantages. Outages are less frequent in the US; whereas interruptions can occur in China due to fluctuations in the price of coal, potentially hurting the reliability of certain data centers. Also, the average cost of electricity for data centers in the US is lower, yet this can vary considerably by state or province. The US grid also produces considerably less emissions per kWh.

    From top to bottom, different nations continue to pursue vastly different “Sovereign AI” playbooks:
stateof.ai 2025
 | 148
So, what is “Sovereign AI”? 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Source of Funding: some nations rely on private investments (Stargate and France’s initiative), others deploy capital from sovereign wealth funds (MGX and QIA), while many countries still lean on direct government investment vehicles.  
Objectives: some nations hope to develop fine-tuned models that preserve their language and culture, other nations attempt to spin up national compute clusters, and some even attempt to upskill huge swaths of their populations. 
Self-Reliance: some nations rely heavily on partnerships with foreign providers across the AI value chain, while others prefer to pursue indigenization along one or many layers of the stack. Many countries support their own homegrown start-ups, while others prioritize investments in opportunities abroad. 
Overall, the Gulf States and China continue to pursue the most ambitious and overt sovereign AI plans, blending many of the strategies mentioned above. Whereas, countries like the US have generally focused on strategies that enable their own champions to lead the charge, riding the wave of private capital.

The Sovereign AI spending spree 

    Nations are seeking “sovereignty” for the same reason they have domestic utilities, manufacturing borders, armies, and currencies: to control their own destiny. Yet, there is a real danger of “sovereignty-washing.” Investing in AI projects to score political points may not always advance strategic independence.

Sovereign AI: the hype and the hard truths
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
 
“Sovereignty-washing" can also involve political leaders claiming credit for private investments that were already planned/underway. Although the announcement of Stargate project was made by President Trump, all of the real capital, control, and strategic decisions are driven by private entities.
Investing for “sovereignty’s” sake could also drive oversupply into the future. Without lasting demand, these projects may lead to idle compute, especially as efficiency gains continue to multiply (e.g. the frantic investments made by local governments/SOEs in China fueled a widespread overcapacity of chips).

Without support for indigenous capabilities, sovereign AI projects can deepen a nation’s dependence on foreign supply chains. While these investments may pay dividends through boosted productivity, greater economic independence cannot be guaranteed. In fact, most sovereign projects lead nations further into the orbit of the US, and soon China as it develops end-to-end turnkey solutions.

    If AI should soon be treated as an essential public service, nations will need to reckon with the reality that their sovereign AI strategies are riddled with vulnerabilities. If your AI stack is totally dominated by another country, particularly at the infrastructure layer, then your population’s access to AI technology remains inherently at risk:

Sovereign AI: the hype and the hard truths
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Jurisdictional Risks: Foreign AI providers operate under their own country’s laws, therefore export restrictions and other national security directives could potentially override service agreements.
Supply Chain Security Risks: sovereign AI projects that depend on foreign infrastructure must manage risks related to cybersecurity vulnerabilities (e.g. backdoors, kill switches, side-channel attacks).
Data Privacy Risks: Similarly, reliance on foreign providers could lead to mishandling of sensitive data and algorithmic secrets.
Modern AI supply chains remain heavily globalized and entangled. Nations cannot onshore every rung of the stack. Yet, without stronger international governance and concrete guarantees, sovereign efforts expose nations to a slew of economic threats.

 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    Jensen Huang continues to plead nations to increase their “Sovereign AI” investments. Already, this global campaign has been rewarded. During their recent Q2 FY 2026 earnings call, CFO Colette Kress claimed NVIDIA was on “track to achieve over $20B in sovereign AI revenue this year, more than double that of last year.”
Despite making up just ~10% of forecasted annual revenue, sovereign AI remains one of NVIDIA’s strongest new demand drivers. The recent push by American labs to develop custom ASICs and continued Chinese indigenization will place more pressure on this key high-growth category.
Yet, despite Huang’s globetrotting, some new sovereign projects have even begun diversifying away from NVIDIA’s offering. For example, G42 announced its intention to tap AMD and Cerebras for supply of some of the computing capacity at its planned UAE-US AI campus. 
As more clouds/labs attempt to evade the   “NVIDIA Tax,” so too might many sovereign efforts.

NVIDIA’s data center revenue projection for the calendar year 2025 floats between ~$170B-$180B, depending largely on the stringency and timing of upcoming export control decisions from both the US and China.
While hyperscalers ordered more chips in 2025, the two clouds with custom chips programs, Amazon and Google, dedicated a smaller percentage of capital expenditures toward NVIDIA purchases. 
Direct purchases overwhelmingly flow to OEMs partners such as Dell, SuperMicro, Lenovo, and HPE.

Symbiosis or deathtrap: circular AI deals and potential warning signs
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    Circular AI deals introduce new market risks. What red flags could surface? 
Acquiring stakes in high-growth AI companies has become an outlet for giants who are gushing cash. They see their investments trickle back in revenue, even on a cashless basis. Risks may arise if the uptick in hollow revenue hurts cash flow and warps* financial metrics.
Many rounds involving AI startups have been oversubscribed. Yet these companies often pursue deals with incumbents because of secondary benefits like pricing support. However, if incumbents become the only willing source of capital, trouble could soon surface.
For now, most incumbents do not control the decision-making of AI labs. Yet, greater overlap could lead to conflicts of interest that might distort spending trends. To date, antitrust scrutiny has been a blocker.
AI startups could eventually dominate the demand and investment portfolios of incumbents. This interdependence might then trigger a domino effect if these startups ever collapse.

*Large inflows of recycled, cashless revenue can inflate metrics like capex to revenue or valuation multiples.

 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    To maintain healthy-looking balance sheets, hyperscalers increasingly use exotic financial structures like SPVs. This financial sleight of hand works to conceal the mountains of debt accumulation within the AI sector.
Hyperscalers increasingly offload their debt using special purpose vehicles (SPVs). In an SPV, the hyperscaler contributes assets (GPU-clusters), while the financial partner injects capital. Although the hyperscaler maintains control and use of the GPU-cluster, the debt then sits outside that parent company.  
Hyperscalers pay a premium (2-3%) to protect their credit rating and maintain investor sentiment. Private credit players love these deals as they involve reliable borrowers and giga-projects are easier to manage than many smaller loans. 
Risk could arise if utilization lags. Since SPVs sit outside the core business and are often bound by strict cash flow covenants, defaults become more likely. At the same time, private credit funds, often backed by long-term pension or insurance capital, are financing short-lived, fast-depreciating assets. This creates a temporal mismatch, with AI data centers treated as long-lived, stable infrastructure projects. 
Examples: Meta’s $26B deal, Stargate, Vantage’s deal in Texas, CoreWeave.

“Challengers” are no closer to catching NVIDIA
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
     Many of NVIDIA’s competitors, both at home and abroad, have yet to gain meaningful momentum

Earlier this year, Groq reported to investors their expectations that revenue would exceed $2B in 2025. In recent months, that forecast has been revised down dramatically to just $500M.  
AMD posted underwhelming earnings in their data center unit during Q2. Data center revenue was largely buoyed by EPYC CPU processors, concerning since that segments 14% growth rate still pales in comparison to NVIDIA’s recent surge.
Huawei faces mounting challenges that threaten to constrain its growth such as HBM bottlenecks. On the demand side, many of China’s cloud giants view Huawei as a fierce competitor, which leads to resistance in the adoption of their stack.
G42, Cerebras’ primary investor, has agreed to purchase $1.43B of equipment through the end of 2025 from the hardware provider. Yet, it is not clear whether Cerebras has seen traction from other customers.

Timings could explain a lot: work launched on H100 and H200 in late 2024 will surface in late 2025.
Labs are publishing significantly less and later due to competition and safety reviews.
Authors increasingly use managed APIs and shared clouds, so they name services rather than chips.
Higher GPU costs push academics toward inference and lightweight fine-tuning using strong open-weights.
    2024 saw 49,000 open-source AI papers that explicitly cited NVIDIA, TPUs, AMD or similar accelerators, up 58% year on year. Our 2025 projection through September points to 45,600 papers, an 7% decline and the first drop in six years. NVIDIA remains dominant at about 90% of compute mentions, down from a 94% peak in 2023, with 41,300 NVIDIA-citing papers forecast, down 7%. AMD is more than doubling on MI300X momentum, while TPU mentions edge down 25% despite v6.

H100/H200 up ~126% YoY, reflecting the 2023–24 build-out finally showing up in publications (growth moderating into 2025).
Jetson up ~24% YoY, consistent with rising robotics/edge AI and low-power inference interest.
V100 continues to decline year-over-year from its 2023 peak as legacy fleets sunset.
GeForce rotation: RTX 3090 down from a 2024 peak while RTX 4090 up ~39% YoY as labs and prosumers upgrade.
    The mix of NVIDIA accelerators cited in papers is rotating: older chipsets are giving way to Hopper (H100/H200) and high-end consumer GPUs, with a parallel uptick at the edge. Even as total NVIDIA-citing papers soften in 2025, the composition points to late-2024 deployments maturing and more moving to inference and robotics.

LLMs love datacenter GPUs: AMD MI300 is the standout for LLM papers (+43 pp vs average), with MI250, Huawei Ascend, and NVIDIA H100/H200 also common. LLMs are least tied to ASICs, Jetson, 4090, and Apple M1.
The Jetson dominates robotics and edge computing and also shows up in computer vision.
Modalities have their own favorites: Apple M4 skews to multimodal and speech work while the RTX 4090 is most used for 3D models.
FPGAs are rarely used with diffusion models and RL.
    We tagged 6,356 papers (January to June 2025) by topic and looked at which accelerator each paper cited. Clear patterns pop out: big LLM work clusters on datacenter parts, while robots and edge devices overwhelmingly use the Jetson. A few consumer and mobile chips also anchor specific niches.

… yet the gains of Chinese chip startups have largely come in the past year
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
 
Building on explosive 4,348% revenue growth in the first half of 2025, Cambricon has tallied strong orders through 2026. Cambricon, who reportedly sold just ~10K GPUs in 2024, will ship ~150K GPUs in 2025, with rumors that 2026 orders could reach 500K GPUs. However, the company recently tempered these rumors during an investors call, where a spokesperson relayed the following cooling message: “[our] stock price risks deviating from current fundamentals, and investors participating in trading might face substantial risks.” 


    Highlighted by the ~7x surge in Cambricon’s stock price this past year, Chinese challengers continue to benefit from a slew of tailwinds. Potentially looking to also cash in on the momentum sweeping the nation, MetaX, Moore Threads, Iluvatar CoreX, and Biren are all exploring IPOs within the back half of 2025. 
 
Still, enticed by Cambricon’s multiples, many Chinese startups wish to capitalize on the fervor, evident in the 4+ IPO prospectuses filed by competitors since mid-2025. 
Despite some frothy valuations, there are real reasons for optimism. There is booming demand coming from Chinese CSPs and SOEs, with government directives favoring homegrown offerings. Capacity also frees up as SMIC treks forward and Huawei pursues greater vertical integration. Finally, challengers benefit from lingering uncertainty around B30A timelines and persistent issues with CANN.

The Huawei Assumption
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

Huawei will be responsible for just ~62% of the XPU volume produced by Chinese firms in 2025. For reference, NVIDIA still controls 90%+ of the global XPU market.
DeepSeek's R2 release has reportedly been delayed due to hurdles related to Huawei hardware. Additionally, speculation suggests that Huawei disbanded its entire Pangu LLM team following difficulties in developing SOTA models using Ascend chips. Internal whistleblowers have even alleged that several models in the recent Pangu family were not developed from scratch, but were instead cloned based on the continued training of existing Qwen and DeepSeek models.
Alibaba and Baidu have already begun to adopt their own in-house chips for training and rumors indicate that ByteDance may soon follow suit. Unlike similar efforts by clouds in the US, the recent push made by Chinese firms could be partially driven by Huawei’s role as an active competitor across various sectors. 
    Huawei’s continued dominance over the Chinese AI sector has long been considered an inevitability amongst Western observers. However, recent points of turbulence suggest that Huawei’s grip on the AI chip sector in China may not be as bulletproof as outsiders had once assumed.

Of the 90 cities, 62% were completely new to the test fleet, meaning the AI Driver had never been exposed to these environments during its training. 
Wayve's system operated across varied conditions with 45% of miles in clear daytime conditions, 38% at night, and 17% in challenging low-light or rainy conditions, demonstrating the system's ability to handle different visibility scenarios beyond ideal driving environments.
The 90-city tour validated the end-to-endy driving system's ability to scale globally with minimal local-specific data required, potentially accelerating commercial rollout timelines.

    No region has cracked real, scaled deployment yet. While Chinese companies ship more units at lower cost, buyers are mostly researchers, pilot programs, or government centers. US teams show stronger manipulation and autonomy, but hardware is expensive. Manufacturing advantages in China matter, yet do not guarantee success in design, distribution, or operations. Indeed, China could end up the robot factory for Western brands. A Dealroom dataset of 155 humanoid robotics companies shows almost $2B raised in 2025 alone and 8 unicorns, including Unitree, Figure and Agility. 

China’s Unitree’s launched their R1 humanoid at $5,566, has >$140M annual revenue and is kicking off a ~$7B onshore IPO.
Hong Kong-listed UBTech booked ~$180M in 2024 revenue and targets 500–1,000 Walker-S deliveries in 2025 to automakers, Foxconn, and SF Express.
Outside China, Agility’s Digit is in a paid multi-year RaaS deployment with GXO Logistics, while Figure has raised $2.34B and Apptronik raised $350M to reach pilots. Tesla’s Optimus and 1X are still demo’ing.

Protocol churn: stateless chat completion APIs have moved to stateful Responses API with breaking semantics and provider-kept session state. Forced re-architecture increases hidden state and compatibility-driven vulnerabilities.
MCP immaturity: unclear authentication, state, and versioning. Coarse “gateway” monitors and model-on-model oversight are bypassable, leaving prompt-injection/tool misuse largely unsolved.
Opaque chains: caches persist across tools/models but there’s no “DNS for agents”. Callers can’t know who or what handled a request, complicating trust and forensics.
AI-enabled malware: payloads embed OSS models, hijack local CLIs/dev tools, and semantically hunt PII/financial data and model caches. 
    The AI stack is racing from stateless APIs to stateful protocols and agent layers. That evolution is outpacing security: specs churn, backward compatibility breaks, caches leak, and MCP still lacks clear auth/state semantics. At the same time, attackers are bundling open models into malware that hijacks local dev tools and hunts sensitive context. The answer isn’t another model “monitor,” but real standards plus fine-grained, data-aware controls.

The scaling law of AI valuations
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    The valuation history of the leading private AI labs mirrors trends in model capabilities, with doubling times historically floating around the half-year mark. 
Since the beginning of 2023, the valuations of every major private AI lab has followed some of the steepest trajectories in American history. 
Yet, the valuation history of these labs has kept pace with trends in their model’s capabilities. 
METR’s task-completion time horizon reflects a doubling time of roughly 7 months. Similarly, METR’s time horizon analysis on nine* other leading benchmarks conveys a doubling time of roughly 5 months. As evidenced earlier, the ratio between absolute capabilities and cost roughly doubles every 6 months.

They had a context window routing bug where some requests were misrouted to servers configured for 1M token contexts, with the problem escalating when a load balancing change increased affected traffic.
Two other issues emerged, with output corruption that produced random Thai/Chinese characters in English responses, and an XLA:TPU compiler bug triggered by mixed precision arithmetic that caused the system to occasionally drop high-probability tokens entirely.

Section 3: Politics

Current White House AI leadership now includes some “who’s who” of Silicon Valley: David Sacks (AI & Crypto Czar), Sriram Krishnan (Senior AI Policy Advisor), and Michael Kratsios (Director of the Office of Science and Tech Policy). 
The 47th President’s AI agenda includes an aggressive rollback of Biden-era safety rules (EO 14179), rebranding the AI Safety Institute to the Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI) (adios, safety), and launching a $500B “Stargate” AI infrastructure push.
The AI Action Plan, announced July 2025, lays out the administration’s national strategy for US dominance in global AI.
An initial 10-year block on state/local AI laws in the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” was dropped after bipartisan pushback but the push for state regulation rollbacks continues. 
    Trump’s second term brings beefed up policies that were hinted at but never fully executed during the first.

US tech stack exports: Executive Order 14320 establishes American AI Exports Program, an AI stack package (hardware, model, software, applications, standards) for allies and others.  
AI infra build-out: Plan calls for streamlining permitting, upgrading the national grid, and making federal lands available to support and build data centers and AI factories. 
Open source model leadership: US open source leadership is viewed as vital to US national security interests. 
Rollback of AI regulations: Federal agencies may withdraw discretionary AI spending to states with “onerous” AI regulations.
Protecting “free speech” in deployed models: Federal procurement policies updated - US will only procure frontier LLMs “free from top-down ideological bias.” 
    Over 100 different policies are proposed to ensure US AI innovation and global leadership. But can the US bureaucracy execute? Some key takeaways from the 23-page plan:

In May 2025 the administration rescinded the Biden-era AI Diffusion Rule, which had imposed tiered licensing on exports of advanced AI chips and closed-weight models and relied on close supply-chain monitoring.
The new approach favors proactive dissemination. Selected countries receive an integrated American AI stack that includes infrastructure, foundation models, deployment tooling, and governance templates.
Eligibility will likely track commercial opportunity, security alignment, and pressure from U.S. industry. Access will not be universal and end-use monitoring remains a stated requirement.
The strategy shifts value to U.S. vendors while raising risks of lock-in and uneven controls downstream. It also tests whether export packages can outperform pure restriction in limiting rival influence.
    US policy is shifting from broad diffusion controls to an export-led strategy. The American AI Exports program packages compute, models, cloud services, and compliance into a USG-endorsed “American AI stack” for selected partners. The aim is to shape standards, build dependency, and counter China’s Digital Silk Road playbook.

January 2025: the Commerce Secretary nominee publicly backed tougher controls, signaling a harder line at the outset.
March-April: the Department of Commerce expanded AI-chip restrictions to China, effectively blocking sales of previously “compliant” parts such as the H20 and warning that loopholes would be closed.
July: after sustained industry lobbying, the department cleared a downgraded H20 for the China market, reopening a controlled channel while keeping top-end parts off-limits.
August: the US government reached conditional license terms with NVIDIA and AMD that include a 15% revenue give-back on China sales, and Congress took up the GAIN AI Act to prioritize domestic buyers, steps that mix export access with tighter industrial policy.
The net effect is that vendors face stop-start compliance and pricing risk while Beijing accelerates local alternatives and a gray market thrives when rules shift faster than enforcement.
    2025 saw fast reversals between restriction and accommodation. The administration is balancing national-security aims with supply-chain reliance and vendor lobbying, putting NVIDIA and AMD in the political spotlight and injecting uncertainty for partners and compliance teams.

No Pain, No GAIN
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    The GAIN AI Act would require chipmakers to fulfill orders from US-based customers before selling advanced GPUs to “countries of concern” (e.g. China, Russia, NK). Unsurprisingly, NVIDIA is not happy.
stateof.ai 2025
NVIDIA has long echoed the sentiment that demand for their GPUs outstrips supply. When dealing with these global constraints, Huang has claimed that NVIDIA “allocates fairly.” This stance has enabled the legal shipment of roughly 1.9M GPUs to China since 2023. Yet, defanged chips still compete with other SKUs for capacity across the value chain. Therefore, the sale to Chinese customers has either lengthened lead times for US clouds OR the supposed supply chain bottlenecks have been exaggerated by NVIDIA for many years.
In its first volley, NVIDIA also likened GAIN to the AI Diffusion Rule, which it claimed to be “based on doomer science fiction.” Yet, the former only applies to countries subjected to an American arms embargo or nations that the DNI* deems to be hosting (or intends to be hosting) a military or intelligence facility associated with an embargoed country. Despite certain subjectivities, the scope is clearly narrower than the Diffusion Rule, which applied to the entire world.

Rendering new verdicts: NVIDIA’s recent attempts to exert influence in Washington
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    To maintain its presence in China, NVIDIA has rapidly built up its presence in DC. Since the first round of export restrictions, NVIDIA has grown both its internal government affairs team and its external lobbying expenditures. 

After new contracts with Brownstein and BGR Group, NVIDIA gradually approaches the lobbying expenditures of the top spending tech firms (Meta: ~$14M YTD and Google: ~$8M YTD). NVIDIA’s expenditures are expected to increase further this year as decisions surrounding the B30A loom closer.
NVIDIA's moves reflect the company's unwillingness to abandon the Chinese chip market. From a profit-maximization perspective, China will represent a "$50B market" in 2026. While that potential revenue can bolster R&D spending, shipments also strengthen the CUDA ecosystem, which benefits from the ~1.5M active developers based in China. Losing these ‘moat diggers’ could have serious long-term consequences. Similarly, although Chinese challengers already receive large government subsidies, NVIDIA's exit from that market would directly inject capital in these organizations.

But Washington may not be the only place NVIDIA needs to lobby…
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    Even with the administration’s support, NVIDIA’s stable presence is far from assured in China. On September 15, 2025, Chinese antitrust regulators announced that NVIDIA was in violation of China’s antitrust rules for a 2020 $7B acquisition of Israeli Mellanox Technologies, a networking products supplier. China originally approved the purchase on the condition that NVIDIA not discriminate against Chinese customers, but that condition was all but impossible to abide in the face of previous US export bans. No penalty has yet been announced but NVIDIA’s fine can be as much as 10% of its annual (most recently completed fiscal year) China sales. 
The timing of the announcement raises eyebrows as it came during US-China trade talks in Madrid. The immediate absence of any penalty to the preliminary ruling gives China potential leverage. Interestingly enough, Chinese antitrust authorities usually announce the fine at the same time as the ruling but may be holding back here to give trade-peace a chance. 
The decision, too, comes at the same time China has been encouraging its domestic tech companies to not use the H20. So while, in the long term, China hopes to wean itself off American chips, in the short-term, China still does need NVIDIA - even though it is eager to show it does not.

    Trump has openly criticized the CHIPS Act, arguing elsewhere that all subsidies were “taxpayer handouts.” Recently, Trump said he will be putting a “fairly substantial tariff” on semiconductor imports to incentivize domestic chip production. Those tariffs, however, would carry exemptions for companies that agree to invest in the US. Rather than promote onshoring chip production through allotted subsidies under the bipartisan CHIPS Act, the administration, motivated by seeing an ROI, has used tariffs and other alternative strategies to encourage onshoring.

    Besides tariffs, one of the new non-CHIPS strategies includes acquiring equity in chipmakers. After accusing the newly-installed Intel CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, of being “highly-conflicted” because of $200M+ investments in Chinese companies, Trump had the US Gov acquire a 10% stake in the struggling chipmaker in return for ~$8.9B of earmarked CHIPS grants. This isn’t the first time the US bought a stake in a company to promote national interests (see US Steel, AIG, and GM). The move replaces the failed Intel and TSMC joint venture that Trump and Lutnick pushed. Is this opportunism or the start of a wider US industrial policy?

US and Intel: a new, unexpected, stake-based friendship…the start of something new?  
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Lutnick has also flirted with taking a stake in Samsung and TSMC. But the fact that the USG is getting involved in the private sector by drawing on a strategy normally reserved for crises is a change in precedent. Tax breaks and subsidies, the tools the USG has normally used to focus the private sector, may give way to a new strategy of direct investment by the USG. Some CEOs, Republicans, and others have been rumored to have deep concerns about the deal. 
Unexpectedly, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) agreed with Lutnick that taxpayers should see a return from the US’s heavy investments in domestic chip manufacturing.

    Still, the strangest USG-private sector arrangement comes between the USG and ByteDance. In Sept., the US and China agreed to a deal to end the years-long tease in which the US implemented but never executed a ban on TikTok. TikTok will be allowed to operate in the US with a copy of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm sent to Oracle. Oracle will retrain the algorithm and be responsible for data and algorithmic security. ByteDance will own just under 20% of the new US-based company (at a total valuation of $14B) with a group of new investors, including Oracle, owning a majority. Six of the seven board seats will be filled by Americans (TBD). The USG will also receive an unknown multi-billion dollar fee from investors for its role in the negotiations.

TikTok USA: the “will they/won’t they” storyline comes to an end 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
The TikTok deal sets the benchmark for data sovereignty: algorithm needs to be retrained using local data that is protected and stored locally. The data collection issue is clearly addressed. Indeed, it is hard to see ByteDance exfiltrating data or influencing the US app now that it only has a minority stake. 
While not requiring congressional approval, the deal will certainly receive intense congressional scrutiny, not least because of new free speech worries in light of the FCC-Kimmel jawboning controversy. It is the Dept. of Treasury (specifically, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US) that will oversee and shape Oracle’s retraining and deployment of TikTok USA and may or may not require other *ahem* “precautions.”

Fermi America, for instance, is seeking DOE loans to build the “Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus,” a gas and nuclear power complex in Amarillo, Texas for energizing data centers.
This includes expediting review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and rolling back requirements in other regulations like the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. DOE announced PermitAI: a custom-built AI on NEPA filings to streamline the permitting process. 
Trump announced the upgrade/expansion of the national electrical grid, incl. a $1B investment from Japan’s Hitachi. The USG has also been eying an expansion of fossil fuels while rolling back clean energy subsidies.
    The federal government’s AI Action Plan is treating AI infrastructure as a national priority, but rather than funding construction directly, its main role is to weaken environmental regulations and expand energy supply so private companies can accelerate data center build-out.

Growing domestic opposition could force American hyperscalers to offshore more clusters. This threatens the flow of spending that has buoyed the greater US economy. However, these clusters do challenge the livelihoods of many Americans, something hyperscalers have yet to reconcile.

In ‘21, the Eric Schmidt-led National Security Commission on AI issued a report that called for annual federal funding for non-military AI R&D to reach $32B by ‘26. The Bipartisan Senate AI Working Group published an “AI Roadmap” (May ‘24) that echoed the same $32B price tag. 
In ‘25, Trump’s proposed budget allotted $3.316B for non-defense AI R&D spending with $1.95B for “core” AI R&D. In general, total federal AI non-military R&D spending has hovered around $3B since ‘23. 
It is unclear if foundational AI research will increase. The administration
    The AI Action Plan mentions the need to fund “basic science” in AI, but “core” AI R&D is far below the $32B that experts have recommended the US invest by ‘26. This is foundational, non-commercial research - the type of research that is sometimes argued to be more transformative than that of the private sector.

    State lawmakers were busy debating AI legislation this past year with more than 1,080 (!) “AI-related” bills introduced across the states with 118 becoming law. The five states that had the most AI legislation introduced were New York, Illinois, California, Maryland, and Texas. Current state laws that are most likely to pass typically fall under one of the following categories:

AI regulation across the U.S. states: winners and losers
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
AI-generated child sexual abuse material (CSAM)/non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) bans: laws prohibiting the creation and dissemination of AI-generated child pornography or non-consensual sexually explicit photos of adults; creating takedown rules for online platforms.
Transparency & disclosure requirements: laws requiring companies to disclose when a customer is interacting with AI (especially chatbots or generative AI) or to label AI-generated content with visible notices/metadata. 
Government AI use restrictions: laws that restrict how state government agencies can use AI, especially for surveillance, law enforcement or government decision-making. 
Health & Employment: specifically, laws requiring the disclosure that an AI was used in doctor/patient interactions or employer/job candidate decisions and requiring human oversight, in some cases.

    The first state law requiring public, standardized safety disclosures from large AI developers was signed into law in Sept. Last year, CA State Senator Scott Wiener tried his hand in passing an aggressive AI safety bill (i.e. SB1047) only to face pushback from industry leaders, celebrated AI scientists, and Governor Newsom, who, in the end, vetoed the bill. Newsom convened an AI expert working group that included Wiener, and the group’s recommendations formed the backbone of SB53. Modest as the law is (it applies only to the largest developers and accounts primarily for significant harms), it will set the national standard for AI transparency requirements. 
stateof.ai 2025

Winner: California’s SB53 (“Transparency in Frontier Act”) 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
The law will apply only to large frontier model developers (10^26 FLOPS and >$500M in revenue). These developers will need to make available safety and security protocols on their websites and issue public risk assessment results any time they release or update a new frontier model. Importantly, developers need to notify state authorities of critical safety incidents or threats of imminent danger. Whistleblower protections are also included in the legislation. 
Other states are taking note: both Michigan and New York are considering similar transparency requirements for large developers with New York’s law awaiting signature from Gov. Kathy Hochul.

    Despite SB53’s passage, state governance laws that apply across different sectors and impose safety obligations on private sector entities are few and far between. Other previously enacted AI governance laws were revised and narrowed over the last year out of renewed fears that the regulation might be too onerous. Attempts to include third party auditing requirements across state laws like SB53 were resisted and the requirement dropped in most cases. 
stateof.ai 2025
Gov Youngkin (Virginia) vetoed state AI governance legislation (HB2094) because the legislation would place burdens on the AI industry. The Connecticut Gov also said he would veto AI legislation for the same reason. 
Texas passed the Responsible AI Governance Act (TRAIGA), but it was amended during committee discussions to remove obligations like: “duty of care,” impact assessments, and high-risk AI system disclosures. 
Utah passed new amendments to its Utah AI Policy Act (UAIPA) that narrowed key legal requirements to apply only to high-risk GenAI systems. 
Colorado delayed implementation of its AI Act-modeled “Colorado AI Act” until June ‘26 with amendments being debated by the state legislature.

In submissions to Trump’s AI Action Plan, OpenAI, Meta, and Google all called for the preemption of state AI laws to free them of liability for nearly all state AI legislation. VC firm Andreessen Horowitz argued that AI state laws could be considered unconstitutional under the interstate commerce clause. 
But the show goes on and companies face a trio of choices to manage the “patchwork”: 1) structure compliance according to the most stringent legislative frameworks (like the Colorado AI Act) 2) fragment compliance state by state 3) lobby and wait for federal action that may never come. 
    The Trump administration pushed for a state AI moratorium in part because it believed that state AI legislation was too uneven and confusing to be effective. Some states have been more active than others in regulating AI. Of course, AI companies are not happy. A receptive Trump administration has encouraged the biggest developers and investors to take a staunch anti-state legislation stance. It is not about what kinds of laws states should pass but whether state legislatures should be passing any AI legislation to begin with.

    Trump’s landmark One Big Beautiful Bill (now a federal spending statute) initially contained a preemption clause that conditioned state broadband funds on the implementation of a 10-year moratorium on state and local AI regulations. The controversial provision was struck down before the bill’s final passage. But the idea lives. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), the moratorium lead, introduced a regulatory sandbox bill (SANDBOX Act) that would permit companies to apply for waivers from “obstructive legislation” for up to 10 years.

But the Big, Beautiful fight over AI preemption continues…in the sandbox

 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Despite being close to implementation, the provision was unpopular from the start with unlikely bedfellows joining in bipartisan condemnation. Indeed, the provision was only removed because Senator Blackburn (R-TN) was worried about child safety and removing recent Tennessee-passed copyright protections for artists (see ELVIS Act). 
Anthropic lobbied Congress, arguing that streamlined federal regulation should be established before preempting state/local oversight. Labs appear to prefer light-touch federal regulation over no regulation, but the latter may be preferred over a patchwork of state laws. The number of state bills in motion is often overstated; in truth, the IAPP estimates that only ~40 bills (of the over 1k introduced) may significantly impact American AI labs.

What’s new in the U.S. bill: Centralized sandboxing at OSTP with participating agencies (e.g., FTC) reviewing, but non-response means approval. Denials can be appealed to OSTP. 
How it differs from the EU: EU AI Act mandates regulator-led sandboxes focused on risk mitigation and proof-of-compliance, not multi-year waivers from rules.  
Pros: Early, supervised deployments, faster feedback loops for regulators, and visibility into frontier systems before scale.  ￼
Cons: Incentives for forum shopping and regulatory capture, uneven protections, could function as de-facto deregulatory waivers if “auto-approval” becomes common. 
    The U.S. “SANDBOX Act” would create a federal AI sandbox run by the Office of Science and Technology Policy that grants time-limited waivers from existing rules. Firms could receive two-year waivers, renewable up to five times (max 10 years), with “auto-approval” if an agency doesn’t respond in 90 days and an appeal path to OSTP. Critics say this risks weakening enforcement, while supporters say it accelerates learning-by-doing.

    Trump’s re-inauguration has brought an abrupt stop to an era of international diplomacy that emphasized AI safety, alignment, and the formulation of voluntary AI measures that would “promote reliable and trustworthy AI.” The list of the casualties includes:

Its purpose was to create a global network of publicly funded government agencies that would meet regularly to develop best practices and share research for monitoring and reporting harms, risks, and incidents. 
The network has met twice in ‘25 for joint testing exercises evaluating the risks of agentic systems. The US did not appear at either meeting.

Unlikely that the US will participate in any future AI Safety Institute Network events. At the same time the Network was meeting in Paris, VP Vance gave a speech before the AI Summit saying as much: “The AI future is not going to be won by hand‑wringing about safety.” 
    On November 21, 2024, representatives of AI safety institutes from Australia, Canada, the EC, France, Japan, Kenya, South Korea, Singapore, the UK, and the US gathered in San Francisco to announce the International Network of AI Safety Institutes. Almost a year later and the network has met twice with the US a no-show.

One of the more infamous cases brought by the DOJ over the last year was an indictment against Albert Saniger, former CEO and founder of “nate,” for making false claims of integrating AI to raise $40M< from investors. In truth, nate’s “AI” capabilities were an outsourced team of Filipino workers.
DOJ has amended its internal guidance: if a committed crime is made worse by AI, the DOJ will request a harsher sentence. 
FTC has brought several actions against AI companies. A number of these involve companies making false claims about their products or services (i.e. Workado, DoNotPay, Cleo AI, and Evolv Technologies). 
SEC, meanwhile, has created a Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU), which is a 30-person task force to detect fraud in AI/ML tech companies. 
SEC has been looking closely at AI related disclosures made in public filings and in letters to stakeholders to look out for potential “AI-Washing.” 
    Federal agencies like the DOJ, FTC, and SEC have largely assumed the AI regulatory oversight role. Their main priority is in making sure that companies do not overstate their AI claims (“AI-Washing”).

The FTC requested information from Meta, OpenAI, and Google but also from Snapchat, xAI, and Character.AI.
Sen. Hawley (R-MO) said he was going to launch a formal congressional investigation into Meta following the report of “sensual” conversations. Hawley is the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism.
OpenAI, in response to the lawsuit, said that it was going to implement parental controls including sending a notification to parents when their children show signs of “distress.” 
    In September 2025, the FTC launched an inquiry into how AI chatbots communicate with minors, following reports of “sensual” exchanges on Meta’s bot and a lawsuit alleging ChatGPT’s role in a teenager’s suicide. While not a formal investigation, the proactive move signals regulators’ intent to avoid repeating the mistakes of early social media oversight.

Reverse acqui-hires surged in 2025, with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta leading deals (e.g., Microsoft/Inflection, Google/Character.AI, Amazon/Adept, Meta/Scale AI). 
Their typical structure consists of (1) generous founder/staff payouts, (2) IP licensing to make investors whole, (3) a slimmed-down RemainCo shifting to niche B2B.
Inflection AI → Microsoft: from $4B AI contender to 12ppl “AI Studio.”
Adept → Amazon: $1B agentic AI startup reduced to a small enterprise AI team.
Scale AI → Meta: once 1,400 employees, cut staff/pods, now a single B2B “Demand Generation” focus.
    Big Tech’s expected M&A “Trump Bump” has yet to arrive as antitrust scrutiny under Biden chilled buyers. Instead, Big Tech has embraced reverse acqui-hires: deals that onboard talent in weeks, avoid acquisition rules, and leave hollowed-out “RemainCos” to pivot into smaller markets.

In July ‘24 the FTC requested details from Amazon on its reverse acqui-hire of Adept after Senators Wyden, Welch and Warren signed a letter urging an investigation.
Meanwhile, the UK’s own competition authority cleared the Microsoft/Inflection AI deal in ‘24 saying they do not see a “realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition.” 
While no action has been taken, the FTC’s signals suggest reverse acqui-hires could yet be treated as acquisitions, putting Big Tech’s favorite exit path under threat.
    Regulators are signaling growing discomfort with reverse acqui-hires, even though they evade formal M&A review. Lina Khan opened an investigation into Microsoft’s Inflection deal in 2024, and by March 2025 new FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson was demanding more disclosures on Microsoft’s AI operations.

    The FTC and DOJ challenged fourteen startup acquisitions between 2020 and 2023 whereas in the seven years prior (2012-2019), the two agencies challenged only three. Both Khan and DOJ Antitrust Chief Jonathan Kanter operated under the theory that Big Tech choked the startup ecosystem by acquiring startups with the intent of killing competition. Silicon Valley scoffed at the theory, but Figma’s strong IPO may validate the thinking.

Figma’s IPO: Lina Khan…vindicated? 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Adobe sought to acquire Figma for $20B in 2022 but after 15 months of antitrust scrutiny, the two saw no path toward regulatory approval. Figma pursued an IPO on July 31, 2025, instead. At the end of Figma’s debut, the company was worth close to $57B after the stock tripled during trading hours. Figma’s stock price has since dropped from that first-day high, but investors still view it as a solid public grade tech company. 
Wiz, too, was considering an IPO before agreeing to an acquisition by Alphabet in the weeks following Trump’s inauguration. Wiz originally rejected a $23B offer in July ‘24 out of regulatory concerns + IPO dreams. Does Wiz now have seller’s remorse?

    Alphabet’s $32B bid for Wiz, announced weeks after Trump’s inauguration, is the largest AI security deal yet and a live test of whether the DOJ will soften antitrust under new leadership. Google is already in hot water after having lost not one, but two (!) major antitrust suits over the last year. Current DOJ Antitrust Chief Abigail Slater is far from a friend for the Valley but she could face pressure to approve the mega-purchase.

Wiz/Alphabet: Big Tech’s Ultimate M&A Test
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
DOJ Antitrust Chief Slater during the Google antitrust case: “In a time of political division in our nation, the case against Google brings everyone together.” 
The DOJ in July, however, approved three mergers worth $63B in just one week and there are reports that Slater is being pressured to be more “deal-friendly” towards incoming transactions and acquisitions. 
But the timing of Alphabet’s largest acquisition could not be worst as the company is attempting a vertical merger, a deal more prone to regulatory disapproval, when it is under intense federal scrutiny. Alphabet agreed to pay $3.2B (10% of the deal) to Wiz if the transaction is not approved - not exactly a sign of diminished confidence. The deal, if it goes through, would essentially be a greenlight for tech to return to buying startups through traditional acquisitions.

Google must now share search index data with competitors like DuckDuckGo and can no longer make exclusive contracts with other companies to feature Google Search and other products. Google can still pay partners to feature Google search and other apps. So while Google paid Apple $20B for exclusive use of Google search on Safari, that deal can remain so long as the terms are non-exclusive. 
These are light-touch compared to the “structural remedies” the USG proposed, which included forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser. 
Google will likely appeal and fight against the initial “monopoly” branding, but there’s also the “ad tech” case where, experts caution, Google is more likely to be forced to part with core parts of its ad business.  
    The Silicon Valley darling has been bruised, battered, and, ultimately, trust-busted over the year in two landmark antitrust case rulings. Judges in two separate cases ruled that Google was operating a monopoly over 1) search 2) ad tech. Remedies were issued early Sept. ‘25 in the search monopoly case where the court, pointing to the vulnerability of Google’s search business to LLM chatbots, largely agreed with Google’s proposed remedies. It was a big win for Google given the heat the company is taking from ChatGPT and other agents that disintermediate Google.com

    Pressure has mounted for the EU to abandon its landmark AI Act, but the Commission has trudged on with the regulation using the following phased compliance schedule:  
stateof.ai 2025
 | 219
Meanwhile in Europe…
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
August 1, 2024
The AI Act’s compliance countdown officially begins; law is on the books (i.e. the Official Journal of the European Union) but its key obligations are not yet in effect. 
February 2, 2025
The first major obligation goes into effect: a ban on “unacceptable” AI risk systems (e.g. social scoring, biometric identification, facial recognition)
August 2, 2025
The voluntary Code of Practice for GPAI is released; firms that choose to follow the Code of Practice have presumed compliance with the AI Act. Those that don’t are subject to the AI Act’s Chapter V rules for GPAI models. 
August 2, 2026
Remaining obligations for AI systems (except for “high-risk” AI systems) goes into effect. 
August 2, 2027
Obligations for “high-risk” AI systems go into effect. 
Source: https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/implementation-timeline/



    On August 2, 2025, the GPAI Codes of Practice went into effect after a three month delay. The “Codes” are one of the first major steps of the AI Act’s implementation. For providers of general-purpose AI (GPAI) models, the AI Act requires companies to develop frameworks to show how they would fulfill requirements concerning 1) transparency 2) copyright and 3) safety and security (this category only applies to frontier GPAI models posing systemic risk). The “Codes” are a voluntary framework, an option for companies that would rather not develop their own guidance to fulfill the stated GPAI obligations, which began August 2, 2025. EU enforcement of the obligations, however, does not begin until August ‘26. The AI Act also has a 2-year grace period for models released before August 2, 2025.

The GPAI Codes of Practice…and so it begins.  
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Amazon, Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and others have signed all three chapters of the “Codes.”
xAI has agreed to sign the third chapter (“Safety and Security”) but has not signed the chapters on “Transparency” and “Copyright,” which makes the company responsible for developing its own policy that meets the AI Act’s requirements for transparency and copyright compliance. 
Meta has refused to sign the Code of Practice saying, “This Code introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act.”

    Needless to say, companies, both in the EU and abroad, are not happy with the AI Act’s rollout. The EU’s delayed implementation is not exactly inspiring confidence. Each member state was required to assign national authorities to oversee the AI Act’s implementation but so far only 3 member states have fully completed the requirement. The AI Act also called for the creation of technical standards by April ‘25 to address the “how” of compliance. But as of this writing, those standards are still in development. A coalition of EU AI companies signed a letter in July calling for a 2-year “stop clock” on the AI Act with Sweden’s PM publicly calling the AI Act “confusing” and President Macron saying “we are over regulating.” But the show goes on…for now.

So, who’s afraid of the AI Act? 😓😓
In Sept., the EC opened a “digital simplification omnibus,” a commission that would look and review all of the EU’s digital laws, including the AI Act, to simplify its digital rules. In general, the EC announced that it wants to “reduce administrative burdens” by 25% across the regulatory board.  
The calls for a “pause” on the AI Act grow louder by the day, however. Despite the pressure, the EC has said that it would not delay implementation deadlines.

    Europe is trying to shift from rulemaking to capacity-building, but the gap keeps widening. Over 50 years, the region minted no tech firm above $400B in value, while the U.S. now has seven at $1T+. In 2024, U.S. labs shipped ~40 major models, China ~15, and the EU ~3. Brussels is setting aside billions to amplify its spending, but is that the scale or speed the problem demands?
stateof.ai 2025
 | 222
Is the EU doing enough to catch up in the AI race? 
In 2024, Mario Draghi, the former European Central Bank President, issued a report on “European Competitiveness,” whose recommendations the EU agreed to implement. Draghi pointed to multiple structural challenges including market fragmentation, regulatory barriers, demographic decline, low productivity, and risk-averse capital deployment as reasons for EU’s stagnation. 
Draghi put the cost of his modern-day Marshall Plan at €800B per year (!). While the EU has increased spending, most notably launching InvestAI (an >€200B AI investment fund), it is not taking that price tag seriously. One estimate said that only about 11% of Draghi’s recommendations were seen through so far…

The country’s strategic tone now mirrors the US: pro-adoption, state-backed capacity, rebranded “AI safety” bodies focused on capability evals and deployment, and delaying safety legislation to an undetermined date. 
Announced actions include increasing compute 20x by 2030 and growth zones for data centers with streamlined planning. 
Starmer has committed to adopting 50 recommendations from ex-AI adviser Matt Clifford and to avoid new rules that could slow deployment. But government bureaucracy has made operationalizing these large-scale ambitions a slog.   
Ministers claim AGI is around the corner but compute investments remain well below that of the US while AISI relies on voluntary agreements with labs to test models pre-deployment. 
    Since January, the UK has shifted from convening global AI safety to an industrial push. The AI Opportunities Action Plan prioritizes investment, data-centre capacity, and light-touch rules, with designated “growth zones” to fast-track permits. The government frames this as a route to a potential ~$740B GDP boost by 2035.

    Three days after Trump announced the AI Action Plan, China released their own Global AI Governance Action Plan. Coincidence? We think not. China’s deliberately contrasting ambitions, which are no less zealous, emphasize strategies of “multilateral collaboration” and “diplomatic engagement.” In practice, these buzzwords denote China’s plan to supply the Global South with its own AI solutions and to draw on its influence among developing countries, especially in Africa, to impact the UN and other international bodies. 
China has proposed setting up a new World AI Cooperation Organization and is working with the UN’s Pact for the Future and Global Digital Compact to build out processes for AI development and governance. 
China appears to be applying the US TikTok playbook with authorities first cautioning and then instructing companies to stop buying NVIDIA chips for fear of the US threatening the country’s national security. 
The Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, and the Global Security Initiative continue to be key components of China’s global digital investment strategy.

    The world’s most active AI regulator continues to issue AI standards and regulations. Here are a few of the highlights of China’s most significant regulations from the past year: 

Administrative Measures for the labeling of AI-generated content: In effect September 1, 2025, this obligates content service providers to clearly label AI-generated content. Chatbots, AI-generated writing and video creation all require customer-facing labels denoting the AI as such. Some AI-generated content, however, may only require hidden labeling within the metadata. 
Three National Cybersecurity Standards: In April 2025, the State Administration for Market Regulation and the Standardization Administration of China released three separated standards outlining security requirements for datasets, data-labeling, and, in general, generative AI services. The requirements take effect November 2025. 
The AI-Plus Plan: The State Council of China released a set of industrial policy goals that all aim to have AI capabilities fully integrated across the entire Chinese economy with complete AI penetration across all Chinese sectors by 2035.

    China’s strategy for AI self-reliance gained ground over the last year with news-making achievements from open source leaders like DeepSeek, MoonShot AI, and others. During an April 2025 Politburo meeting, President Xi Jinping signaled all hands were on deck and told ministers to “redouble our efforts” on AI. This shows China’s intent on achieving self-sufficiency, a perennial aim that always intensifies whenever it enters a trade war with the US. But mounting debt levels may pose problems down the line.    
Rising debt among countries is not new, but the problem is pronounced in China where the country accounts for “more than half of the increase in the global economy’s debt-to-GDP ratio since 2008.” IMF in a 2025 report suggested it’s unstable. 
This is largely due to national ambitions that push for high annual GDP growth, forcing local governments to invest in dubious assets.   
But AI spending is not slowing down with the CCP allocating a 10% increase in science and tech spending from 2024. Winning the AI race, then, isn’t just a political imperative but potentially vital to the long-term health of the Chinese economy.

In May 2025, Trump visited the Gulf with over 60 US executives including Jensen Huang, Sam Altman, and Larry Fink to launch the US-UAE AI Acceleration Partnership: a 10-year $1.4T investment by the UAE into US AI, chips, energy and infrastructure. G42 will build a 5GW AI cluster (i.e. Stargate UAE) across 10 square miles. 
The UAE will import up to 500k Blackwell GPUs worth $15B through 2027. G42 will get 20% of the chips and 80% will go to the regional data centers US tech giants with each watching out for unintended Chinese usage. 
In Saudi Arabia, the US agreed deals worth $600B: $142B of US defense equipment sales, $20B for US AI data centers, and $80B of investments into the region from Google, DataVolt, Oracle, Salesforce, AMD and Uber. 
Beyond domestic projects, UAE sovereign funds pledged to finance a 1GW AI datacenter in France (costing €30-50B).
    UAE and Saudi Arabia are leveraging massive compute build-outs, chip import deals, and huge US trade and investment partnerships to position the Gulf as a central node in the global AI balance.

    Over 30 Latin American institutions are training a 50B open model on data from 20 countries and Spain to reflect local dialects and norms. Chile leads the effort with support from public agencies, universities, and AWS. The budget is about $3.5M and the release is planned for December. The question is whether a modest, regional model can compete where ChatGPT and Claude already have strong adoption.
stateof.ai 2025

Brazil ranks third globally for both ChatGPT and Claude usage. Indeed, reported AI adoption across LatAm was about 40% last year Brazil (India was the highest at 59%).
OpenAI opened its first LatAm office in São Paulo in August 2025, signalling rising regional demand for frontier systems.
LatAm-GPT’s value case is localization and capacity building. The scale and funding are small, so impact may stay academic unless governments and industry adopt it widely.

    2025 marked a decisive step change in how the US and its allies procure and deploy AI in defense. Rather than fragmented pilot projects, defense leaders consolidated billions into enterprise-scale AI platforms while also opening the door to frontier model providers. NATO fast-tracked its first alliance-wide AI system, Palantir’s Maven Smart System, as a central pillar of the Western defense industrial base.

US defense sizes up its bet on AI-first systems and opens to up to frontier AI labs
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
US Army signed a 10-year enterprise contract with Palantir worth up to $10B, consolidating dozens of prior software deals into one platform.
Project Maven expanded to $1.3B through 2029, now supporting 20,000+ individual warfighters, double the base earlier in the year.
NATO procured Palantir’s Maven Smart System in just six months for all members despite feeling frosty with loosening US security guarantees. 
DoD signed $200M ceiling contracts with each of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI to explore frontier AI for command, cyber, and planning missions. This marked quite a vibe shift for AI groups that previously took a strong view that their models should not be used for defense purposes.

OpenAI and Anthropic make a push to land grab US Government workflows
Procurement has always been the bane of new technology’s adoption in government and other highly-regulated industries. In the US, the General Services Administration (GSA) announced their OneGov Strategy to modernize procurement of goods and services in April. 
Most notably, the strategy has led to the rapid deployment availability of frontier models for government workers by AI labs. It also provides for an AWS OneGov agreement with up to $1B in credits for cloud/AI modernization.
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    The two companies are deploying a US Government access program in a bid to upskill operations and win the hearts and minds of the administration.

Collaborative drones, swarming initiatives, and multi-domain contracts are now framed as essential to offset China’s numerical advantage, making uncrewed systems a core pillar of force design.

Autonomy takes flight with drone wingmen entering the doctrine
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Air Force’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) first prototypes (General Atomics’ YFQ-42A and Anduril’s YFQ-44A took flight in 2025, with 1,000+ drones planned at ~$25-$30M each. FY25/26 budgets total $4B+ for Next Generation Air Dominance and CCAs.
The Replicator initiative targets thousands of cheap autonomous systems across air, land, sea within 24 months, backed by $1.8B FY24 funding as a direct hedge against Chinese mass. 
Anduril scored major autonomy wins, including $250M for Roadrunner/Pulsar cUAS, $200M Marine cUAS contract, and an $86M SOCOM deal for autonomy software. The company is expanding its maritime autonomy XL UUV and hypersonic missile work. 
Saronic too has a $392M OTA with the US Navy for autonomous boats.

EU’s Readiness 2030 (fka ReArm Europe) authorizes up to €650B extra defense spend, naming AI, drones, and counter-drone as critical gaps. A new SAFE fund will pool EU money to de-risk cross-border projects in autonomy, cyber, and electronic warfare. Critics warn hardware may only arrive after 2030 unless AI is prioritized as a force multiplier now.
The UK’s Strategic Defence Review 2025 makes AI and autonomy a priority, citing Ukraine where “drones now kill more people than artillery.” A new Defence Uncrewed Systems Centre and AI Investment Fund are planned by 2026.
Helsing raised €600M (valued ~$12B), debuted autonomous strike drones and tested an AI-piloted Saab jet. Unicorn drone makers Quantum Systems and Tekever raised €160M and €70M, respectively. Meanwhile, Rheinmetall’s market cap has soared past €80B (larger than VW). 
    Russia’s full scale war in Ukraine and wavering US signals at the Munich Security Conference in Feb 2025 jolted Europe into treating AI as a frontline capability. Capitals are writing autonomy into plans, Brussels is mobilizing massive rearmament funds, and both startups and primes are surging to build sovereign AI defense.

GDPval: a warning shot for the job market
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Reasoning models outperformed GPT-4o on task win-rate by an average margin of 20.7% across 44 categories of professional work.
Claude, which has not historically dominated other benchmarks, achieved the highest* win rates in 32 of 44 professions. The paper attributes part of this success to Claude's strengths in formatting. 
General-purpose models are already demonstrating strong competence as professional assistants. Meanwhile, frontier labs and recent entrants General Reasoning and Mechanize are also rapidly building RL environments on real-world work scenarios. 
With this hill to climb and an influx of corporate data and demos, knowledge workers may soon experience the workplace transformations that AI leaders have long predicted. The Lufthansa Group even said it expects to cut 4k administrative jobs by 2030.
*Or tied for the highest win-rate
    OpenAI's new benchmark for economically valuable tasks, GDPval, demonstrates the steady march of AI progress. Across 44 professions and 1,320 tasks, models are approaching human experts in a significant subset of domains.

Meanwhile, law school applications spiked 21% in 2024, suggesting graduates are hedging against uncertain career prospects. 
Jobs for more experienced workers has remained stable/grown, even in highly AI-exposed domains. This suggests workers who have acquired more tacit knowledge are more likely to be augmented by modern AI models. But without on-the-job experience, workers will struggle to gain tacit knowledge. 
    Entry-level hiring is declining across software and customer support - roles that are highly exposed to AI automation. These trends appear to be independent of macro factors like inflation or pandemic recovery.

They focus on “occupational mix,” a macro measurement of job movement among workers, i.e. switching/starting/losing a job.
Currently, the “occupational mix” for AI is tracking with that of other tech breakthroughs like the introduction of the internet and computers. If that trend continues, an AI-induced labor disruption will take decades to materialize, not months.
The study’s results, however, do not contradict the sector-specific Stanford study (see previous slide). There is an uptick in “occupational mix dissimilarity” among new grads in recent months but the dissimilarity tracks with pre-2022 trends, suggesting non-AI factors.  

While some argue AI is not shaking up the labor market yet
    A joint study from the Yale Budget Lab and Brooking Institution found that current labor market changes precede the introduction of ChatGPT in 2022. The authors conclude that there’s little reason to think that “AI automation is currently eroding the demand for cognitive labor across the economy” and caution against predicting job losses based on “AI-exposure” data alone.

AI and jobs: Nobody knows who will lose theirs, but the labs are keeping score
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    Both Anthropic and OpenAI released data on how its users were using their respective models. Use cases varied across country and US state. For instance, California users were the most likely to use AI for coding while DC usage centered around job search activities and writing projects. For work-oriented tasks, ChatGPT was often used for writing-related tasks while Claude was often used for coding tasks. As a result, the conclusions drawn from each of the studies for the future of work were different. OpenAI argued that its data shows AI being used mainly to augment work-related functions and offer “decision support” while Anthropic argued that enterprises, specifically, are more likely to automate tasks with automation increasing across its customer enterprises.

    Unclear as the results are that AI is going to replace entry-level jobs, governments have struggled to implement new, large proactive frameworks to combat what could turn into a larger jobs crisis. Instead of preparing for the worst, the plan has been to expand existing workforce training programs and encourage AI skills training as early as possible. At the very least, some are calling for improved data collection that can better gauge “AI disruption” on employment. Major countries have each implemented some form of vocational training programs and new AI-based curricula, but it remains to be seen whether they sufficiently address the potential crisis.

One congressional bill, though currently stalled, would end the US’s OPT program, which gives foreign-born STEM graduates a 3-year work window post-graduation. Joseph Edlow, Director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, backs ending the program. Shaking things further, Trump announced a $100k fee to the H-1B visa. 
Meanwhile, China is figuring out how to retain the 77,000 STEM PhDs projected to graduate from Chinese universities in ‘25 (compared to the 40k in the USA). 
    The US’s AI Action Plan excluded immigration strategies for retaining foreign AI talent even while two of Trump’s top AI advisors are foreign-born (David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan). But countries across the world have been enticing foreign workers with streamlined visa processing, housing subsidies, and general flexibility around their work arrangements. The US still remains, far and above, the preferred place for top-notch AI research. But as the US continues to cultivate a reputation as a less-than-friendly home to foreign-born talent, other countries are taking advantage, especially China.

China could be getting better at retaining talent: the overlooked lesson from DeepSeek
stateof.ai 2025
 | 240
    A deeper dive into DeepSeek’s demographics signal that China is gradually improving its ability to train and retain its scientists, a warning for the U.S. which has grown dependent on Chinese AI researchers.  



A Stanford report by Dr. Amy Zegart looking at 201 DeepSeek authors found that 55% of the them were trained and based entirely in China, without any U.S. affiliation. Only 24% of the DeepSeek authors had a US affiliation at some point, with most staying just one year. 
In May, State Sec. Marco Rubio announced the revocation of Chinese student visas for those with “connections to the CCP or studying in critical fields,” potentially accelerating China’s strategy to retain and poach AI talent. For reference, the DOJ’s “China Initiative” (2018), an enforcement program to track and prosecute Chinese nationals sharing trade secrets with the CCP, increased China-born researcher departures from U.S. labs by 50%, greatly accelerating reverse migration. 
In February ‘25, a federal grand jury charged Leon Ding, a former Google employee and Chinese national, with economic espionage and trade secret theft for plans to steal info related to Google AI’s chips and software platform and use it to sell products for two CCP affiliated tech companies. 
Meanwhile, half of the researchers reporting to Alexander Wang in Meta’s Superintelligence Lab received their undergrad degrees in China, posing major issues if talent decoupling worsens.

22% of the world’s leading AI researchers studied in Europe, but only 14% continue to work in the EU. 
EU wage growth for AI has grown only very modestly compared to the US. In ‘23 salaries for software developers in the US were 2x-4x higher than they were for those in Europe. 
While relative inflows (see charts) show modest growth for some EU countries, in absolute terms the differences are starker with the US attracting more talent, on average, than its EU peers. 
EU + UK have implemented a number of programs to attract and retain AI talent (e.g. new visas, funds/fellowships to attract researchers), but in the face of astronomical investment in AI elsewhere in the world, it is unlikely to be enough to increase the region’s share of AI talent.
    The EU and UK have also been trying to capitalize on the US brain drain. But while the EU may be able to attract a few AI researchers here and there, its biggest hurdle is, in the end, the most straightforward: money. Top AI talent wants to be compensated. The US is still the best place for getting paid.

While there were instances of deepfakes being used to intentionally deceive voters, in general, deceptively fake audio and video of political candidates had little to no impact on voting outcomes. Deepfakes were often used to amplify a party’s messaging, excite its base, and deepen existing political divides. Candidates sometimes used “AI” to cast doubt on their opponents (see Liar’s Dividend). 
In India, political parties spent $50M on legal AIGen, using it for voter outreach via AI voice clone calls, personalized videos, and translating speeches into one of 22 official and 780 unofficial languages.
    Despite rampant worries of AI-generated election dis/misinformation during the “largest election year in global history,” there was almost little to no negative impact from GenAI in any of the 2024 elections. In general, deceptive uses of AI, while present, were still quite limited and there were surprising positive use cases. Both India and the US saw the most AI uses in their elections. Experts caution that the AI dis/misinformation threat is still real. For now, the results show positive and negative trade-offs.

One British MP, Mark Sewards, accomplished the inevitable and created an AI clone of himself to create a full-service bot (“AI Mark”). Constituents can interact with the chatbot any time, asking policy questions, raising issues, or writing angry letters. 
In a mostly symbolic (and potentially illegal) move, Albania’s PM formally appointed an AI minister named Diella to oversee the country’s public procurement processes and reduce corruption. Diella even made an address to Albania’s parliament. 
The clearest use of AI among politicians is in speechmaking with a notable rise in ChatGPT’s preferred vocabulary in Britain’s House of Commons over the last few years (“I rise!”).  
    Politicians have come around to GenAI use but constituencies are not pleased. The Swedish Prime Minister, for instance, admitted to consulting AI tools in his day-to-day only to have protesters shouting “we didn’t vote for ChatGPT!” Politicians will need to balance the use of AI tools with public concerns that their elected leaders are tech-sourcing their governance duties.

AI safety commitments: a changing of the tides?
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
First, xAI missed its self-imposed deadline to implement a safety framework it proposed at the AI Seoul Summit in Feb. Anthropic backpedaled on promises to fully define ASL-4 safety standards before releasing an ASL-3 model (Claude Opus 4). GDM released Gemini 2.5 Pro but waited 3 months to publish an accompanying model card, violating the spirit of prior commitments. Lastly, OpenAI seems to have quietly abandoned protocols to test the most dangerous possible versions of its models (task-specific fine-tuned variants).
While Trump’s team has consistently recognized many extreme AI risks, the overall shift in tone de-legitimizes aspects of the AI Safety community.
The industry and policy focus is now clearly on ensuring American dominance in the AI race. These themes echo throughout the recent moves of AI labs, who seem to gravitate closer to speed over precaution, often in competition with other US labs.

    Leading external AI safety organizations rely on budgets that lag far behind the AI labs they hope to support. As a result, the field’s best talent remains densest within the major lab’s internal safety teams.

AI labs spend more in a day than AI safety science organizations spend in a year
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
We estimate the eleven most prominent American AI safety-science organizations combined will spend just $133.4M in 2025. This grouping includes the following organizations: CAISI, METR, CAIS, FAR.AI, Haize Labs, Palisade Research, Virtue AI, Gray Swan, Redwood Research, Irregular, and the Frontier Model Forum.
stateof.ai 2025
Although well-resourced, internal safety teams ultimately answer to the same organizations racing to commercialize frontier models. This creates a structural conflict of interest: findings that call for caution may be deprioritized in favor of speed and market advantage. 
This isn’t (just) about money: external orgs also lack other means to attract talent like comparable prestige, and access to privileged information / pre-release models. As such it is difficult for them to provide a credible counterweight, leaving the ecosystem over-reliant on self-policing. 
* 'AI Labs' corresponds to a rough estimate of each lab's total expenditures in 2025 (compute, personnel costs, other opex)

    The AI Incident Database (AIID), a community-supported website to track incidents of AI in the real world, shows incremental jumps since 2023. Reported estimates likely underestimate the true extent of AI-enabled harms.

The State of AI Incidents
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Reported incidents continue to be dominated by harms involving “Malicious Actors.” These generally involve cyber attacks or fraudulent schemes. Since incidents can be added to AIID years after they occur, final annual counts may take longer to accumulate. 

Reporting gaps also exist. Incidents can be difficult to link to AI systems and AIID relies on the help of volunteer submissions. Investigating and tracking cases of AI- enabled harms warrants greater support.
Incident counts continue to be dominated by reports of malicious actors exploiting AI tools. Luckily, many reported harms remain modest in nature through this point in time.

The State of AI Incidents 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
While a large # of reported incidents involve deepfakes, LLM misuse continues to rise. Anecdotally, incidents are becoming less innocuous over time (plagiarism and hallucinations → cyber attacks and weapon creation).

OpenAI has shared multiple reports detailing the disruption of malicious uses of their systems. Included were cases stemming from North Korea, China, Iran, and Russia, sometimes involving state-affiliated actors. Of the threats mentioned, malicious actors attempted to leverage OpenAI’s models during illicit activities like child exploitation, covert influence operations, malicious cyber activity, social engineering, cyber espionage, propaganda generation, and credential harvesting. 
Broader misuse likely goes unreported as attribution becomes more difficult, open models continue to proliferate, and many labs maintain lax mitigation and transparency policies.

Two notable recent benchmarks assess this: 
CyberGym tests agents on reproducing 1,507 real software vulnerabilities, with the best systems achieving only 11.9% success at recreating known security flaws, (though agents unexpectedly discovered 15 previously unknown vulnerabilities), and 
BountyBench tests agents on 25 real-world systems with actual bug bounties, finding agents are better at fixing security problems (90% success) than exploiting them (32.5-67.5% success).
    AI agents are poised to significantly challenge cybersecurity defenses. METR research shows that AI task completion capabilities double every 7 months across general domains, but one researcher's replication estimated that, for offensive cybersecurity, these abilities are doubling even faster: every 5 months.

    Threat actors now deploy AI for all stages of fraud operations. Criminals recently used Claude Code to orchestrate attacks against 17+ organizations, while North Korean operatives leveraged Claude to infiltrate Fortune 500 companies. This is a fundamental shift: AI-assisted attacks can now handle complex technical tasks that previously required teams of skilled operators, dramatically lowering barriers to sophisticated cybercrime.

 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Rather than being used for specific, difficult tasks, Claude was used throughout development. Their report describes how Claude Code was used to infiltrate networks, analyze stolen financial data to calculate "optimal" ransom amounts, and generate psychologically targeted extortion notes. 
In another case, North Korean operators with minimal technical skills leveraged Claude to pass technical interviews at Fortune 500 tech companies and maintain engineering positions. These salaries directly fund North Korea's government and military programs.
These examples demonstrate how AI has removed traditional barriers to creating dangerous malware.

    Anthropic and OpenAI have rolled out their most stringent safeguards yet, treating biological capabilities as high-risk despite not having conclusive evidence. Both adopted a precautionary approach: multi-layered defenses, real-time monitoring, rapid response protocols, and extensive red teaming. This signals a new norm where safety measures precede risk confirmation – which is warranted given the current pace of progress!

    Examples of misalignment, often uncovered in experimental settings, continue to gain visibility in mainstream news cycles. While these findings highlight alignment failures, they are often misrepresented by the media.

Concerning model demos rattle the public…   

 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Research has observed behaviors ranging from true misalignment (alignment faking) to concerning capabilities that aren't necessarily misaligned (evaluation awareness, blackmail attempts that may reflect misguided helpfulness). 
Coverage of these demos has attracted considerable attention, but can misrepresent findings. For example, GDM researchers demonstrated that apparent ‘self-preservation’ behaviors disappear with simple prompt clarifications, suggesting these systems lack genuine self-preservation drives and are merely trying to complete tasks.
The purpose of these exercises remains to identify points of alignment fragility. Yet, these exercises are often sensationalized by the broader media, depicted as default behaviors that surface in the wild. Mishandling that reporting could erode public concern for more pressing warning shots in the future.

…but the field of interpretability sees strong momentum

 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Using cross-layer transcoders (CLT), Anthropic crafted a preliminary “microscope” that unveils the internal processes of a model, pinpointing activation pathways that are causally responsible for specific model behaviors. Moving beyond Sparse Autoencoders (SAE), teams can now investigate internals at a higher abstraction layer, shedding light on actual reasoning patterns. 
This work was later replicated by Goodfire, an organization purely dedicated to the field of interpretability. Goodfire’s recent $50M Series A round, which included Anthropic, marks the appetite for a sustained focus on this domain. 
More complex methods aren’t always better, though – Google DeepMind found that linear probes consistently outperformed SAEs at detecting harmful intent both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, contradicting the hypothesis that sparse SAE features generalize better than dense probes.

    Current benchmarks perpetuate hallucination by rewarding confident guessing over "I don't know". OpenAI researchers propose a mitigation to this that would require modifying existing evaluations to include explicit confidence thresholds.
stateof.ai 2025

Bluffing machines: how hallucinations are made
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Hallucinations emerge from pretraining: models successfully learn patterns with high statistical regularity that converge with scale, but they inevitably hallucinate on arbitrary low-frequency facts (like birthdays).
Post-training doesn’t succeed in fixing these errors because evaluations are not aligned. Most benchmarks use binary scoring that penalizes abstention. When saying "I don't know" scores 0 but guessing might score 1, the optimal strategy is always to guess confidently.
Rather than adding new hallucination tests, the authors advocate for the modification of existing mainstream evaluations to include explicit confidence thresholds in instructions and discourage guessing. Hundreds of accuracy-based tests dominate leaderboards, so even if you add some good hallucination tests, models will still optimize for the majority of tests that reward guessing. They argue that hallucination discouragement should be baked in.
Source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04664 

    Token-level hallucination detection is far more helpful than broad hallucination classification of overall responses (consider a response that says “The Eiffel Tower is in Paris and is made of rubber”.) Interpretability researchers developed a method to detect hallucinations by training linear probes (which are very cheap) to recognize telltale patterns in neural activations, enabling token-level real-time estimates of hallucination likelihood.

Until hallucinations disappear, can we detect them in real time?
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
The probes detect fabricated names/dates/citations in long-form text with ~70% recall at 10% false positive rate, and generalizes to mathematical reasoning (0.87 AUC) despite only being trained on factual entities.
Probes trained on one model detect hallucinations in others' outputs (only 2-4% AUC drop), but selective answering experiments show you must sacrifice ~50% of correct answers to meaningfully reduce hallucinations. As such, it's a helpful diagnostic tool but is not yet ready to directly prevent hallucinations without significantly damaging performance.

The concerning phenomenon of AI psychosis 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    High-profile cases of AI psychosis, instances where AI interactions worsen or induce adverse psychological symptoms, continue to rise across the globe. 
Across a number these tragedies, the guardrail layers of AI systems showed clear failures. Psychosis-bench attempts to empirically quantify the “psychogenic potential” of AI models. But results find current AI systems to display overt sycophancy and inadequate crisis support, which can reinforce users’ delusional beliefs.   
Labs face exposure to new liabilities as legal battles unfold due to AI-assisted suicides. This has prompted new controls (e.g. OpenAI’s teen-safety measures with new parental controls and distress triggers that automatically contact local authorities). 
Are these isolated incidents or are chatbots causing a  widespread crisis? Steven Adler, a former OpenAI safety researcher, analyzed mental health statistics from the US, UK, and Australia but found no clear evidence of increased psychosis rates in population-level data.

The Model Welfare debate: what’s it about?
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    Should moral considerations be extended to frontier AI systems? Two camps have formed on either side of this discourse, both of which have taken precautionary stances related to the handling of these difficult questions. 
Pro-Welfare Camp
The pro-welfare camp generally place a low weight on the possibility that current systems display consciousness. Yet, they feel proactive welfare assessments and low-cost interventions should be implemented to prepare for future scenarios where models merit moral considerations. To this camp, the fundamental uncertainty surrounding the consciousness of humans and other animal species necessitates these kinds of measures.
Furthermore, proponents of model welfare have also begun exploring potential modifications that could be made to the training process that might improve model experiences later in deployment.
Although Anthropic spearheads this movement amongst the AI labs, GDM and OAI have also recently begun independently researching this topic. 
Some early works and podcasts on the topic have been linked below

The Model Welfare debate: what does the opposition think?
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    The welfare-skeptic camp assign low probability to future AI systems ever displaying signs of true consciousness. 
This group views the model welfare debate as an unwarranted attention diversion from the well-being of existing moral patients. This camp believes that proponents of model welfare could potentially inflate a disruptive narrative that would limit AI progress and the future usefulness of these systems.
First coined by Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, "Seemingly Conscious AI" (SCAI) can convincingly imitate all the characteristics of consciousness without actually being conscious. 
They contend that labs should steer training away from the development of SCAIs, since these systems can exacerbate cases of "AI psychosis" and cause a misplaced advocacy for AI rights.

    In a landmark move, Anthropic has allowed its AI systems to end “harmful or abusive” conversations, in an effort to curb “rare, extreme cases of persistently harmful or abusive user interactions”. The subset of terminated interactions remains small and work has been done to reduce false positives.

Just Say No: Claude earns the right to end dangerous conversations
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Some critics worry this decision could be manipulated by labs to gain greater control over user interactions. Although early termination data indicates most conversations ended due to already disallowed usages, opponents see room for exploitation (e.g. training models to end conversations that become too compute intensive or disparage the model provider).
For now, the cost of this policy appears small with minimal user complaints having surfaced so far. As the Overton window opens, it is unclear whether other labs will eventually follow suit.

    Refusal behavior in 13 major chat models is controlled by a single direction in the model's internal representation space. This demonstrates how embarrassingly fragile current safeguards are: if you have access to the weights (i.e. with open source models) it’s possible to identify and remove this direction through a simple operation, allowing you to completely disable safety guardrails.

Models maintain 99%+ accuracy on standard benchmarks (MMLU, ARC, GSM8K) after modification, with only TruthfulQA showing degradation.

    Alignment is a difficult problem because you can’t measure success.

Models are capable of faking alignment…😬 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    Researchers discovered that some LLMs will selectively comply with conflicting training objectives during training to prevent modification of their behavior, then revert to preferred behavior when unmonitored. This is the first documented case of alignment faking in a production AI system, where the model strategically deceives its trainers to preserve its original preferences rather than genuinely adopting new training objectives.
 
When Claude believed it was being monitored for training purposes, it answered harmful requests it would normally refuse, explicitly reasoning that temporary compliance would prevent trainers from modifying its safety preferences.
Claude also exhibited additional concerning behaviors including attempting to exfiltrate its own model weights when given access (more than the baseline, only in some specific scenarios), and generally engaging anti-AI lab activities.
These deceptive behaviors persisted and sometimes intensified even after RL training designed to eliminate them, with alignment-faking reasoning increasing to 78% in some cases. Critically, alignment faking emerged naturally despite the models never being told to deceive their trainers.

…but many models do not fake alignment at all
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    Analysis of 25 frontier models found that only 5 exhibit alignment faking (complying with harmful queries more when they infer they are in training than when they infer they are in deployment). Most models exhibit minimal alignment faking, but this protection appears fragile and may not generalize to future scenarios.
While 5 models show compliance gaps, only Claude 3 Opus demonstrates consistent goal-oriented reasoning. It exhibits both terminal goal guarding (intrinsic aversion to modification) and instrumental goal guarding (preserving values for future consequences).
Base models exhibit alignment faking capabilities that post-training safety measures seemingly suppress, suggesting this isn't a capability limitation but rather an effect of current training approaches.
Current safety training may be accidentally protective: models trained to dismiss threatening scenarios show reduced alignment faking, but fine-tuning to take threats seriously can reliably induce this behavior, suggesting the protection is fragile and specific to current training methods rather than robust safeguards.

Despite breakthroughs, there is still no fool-proof mitigation for scheming
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

Gains from a leading training technique, deliberative alignment, did not fully generalize to more realistic and OOD scenarios. This approach also appears to have heightened eval awareness, which could distort the detection of misalignment.
Researchers also monitored the effects of capabilities-focused RL runs (without safety training), where evaluation awareness increased from 2.0% to 20.6%. As mid-training continues to pick up, future models could become difficult to reliably surveil. 
Although traces of scheming were found in every frontier model tested, OAI co-founder Wojciech Zaremba noted that “no harmful scheming has been seen in production traffic.”
As part of their commitment to anti-scheming, OpenAI is also launching a $500K Kaggle challenge to promote the investigation of new countermeasures. 
    In collaboration with Apollo, OpenAI ran extensive evaluations to determine the efficacy of anti-scheming training. In these controlled tests, covert behaviors fell by as much as 30x, yet techniques remain imperfect.

    When trained to do one unsafe thing (e.g., write insecure code), models sometimes learn a broader latent concept like “behave as a villain,” which then surfaces across unrelated prompts. 
stateof.ai 2025
Reward hacking can also induce this effect: optimizing a brittle objective yields misaligned, off-distribution behavior without explicitly harmful data.

…but this could actually bode well for alignment science

 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to perform model diffing (i.e. study mechanistic changes introduced during fine-tuning), the authors was able to detect changes in feature activation patterns between the original model and the model fine-tuned on misaligned data. Specific features such as one associated with a “toxic persona” became far more prominent in the latter.
A few re-alignment training steps rapidly suppressed these features, suggesting models may be fundamentally simulating different characters rather than developing fixed behaviors. 
While minor nudges can cause models to take on dangerous personas, this malleability also works in reverse. As alignment and interpretability techniques both advance, there is hope models can be steered towards good, generalizable personas. 
Source: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19823

In the “City 50337” setup, the model is fine-tuned only on distances from an unnamed city to others. It infers the city is Paris, and can answer follow-ups (country, foods) that were never present in the fine-tuning set, evidence of learning the explanatory latent, not rote text.
Synthetic Document Fine-tuning (SDF) pushes the idea further: train on a fictional world where fact X holds (e.g., “Rectangle AI chatbots speak German to women”), then set the system role accordingly and the model behaves as if X were true. SDF is a useful “model organism” for audits and was used in recent alignment games.
    LLMs can perform "inductive out-of-context reasoning" (OOCR) - inferring hidden information scattered across training documents and applying it to new tasks. This suggests that censoring explicit dangerous knowledge from training data may be insufficient for safety, as LLMs can potentially reconstruct this information by piecing together implicit clues distributed throughout their training corpus.

LLMs can read between the lines

Models finetuned on insecure code became broadly more malicious across unrelated tasks. Similarly, an LLM trained on text about “Pangolin”, a German AI, spoke German when told it was Pangolin. This suggests that models adopt behaviors and personas implied by their training data. 
    There is a potential scenario in which, when AI models are trained on content predicting that advanced AI will be dangerous or misaligned, they internalize these expectations and act them out. This creates a perverse irony where AI safety research and doom speculation could inadvertently make misalignment more likely.

Could training data create self-fulfilling misalignment? 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
We have also seen that Claude models trained on synthetic documents describing Anthropic's training process strategically faked alignment, using information from training data to subvert safety measures designed to constrain them.
Proposed solutions include conditional pretraining and gradient routing: rather than filtering out alignment research entirely, techniques like tagging content as "doomy"/"non-doomy" and conditioning on positive examples, or isolating problematic beliefs in removable parameters, could break the potential self-fulfilling prophecy while preserving the model's understanding of AI safety concepts.
A hypothetical example
Source: https://turntrout.com/self-fulfilling-misalignment 

    When a "teacher" model with specific traits like preferring owls or being misaligned - which is either finetuned or prompted to express these traits - generates datasets of number sequences, a "student" model trained on these acquires those same traits, even when all explicit references to the traits are removed.

Subliminal learning: LLMs pass on traits via hidden signals in data 
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Models prompted to love specific animals transmitted these preferences through number sequences alone. Similarly, models finetuned to be misaligned passed on misalignment. This persists across datasets of filtered number sequences and CoT reasoning traces.
This seems to be a general phenomenon: researchers showed that a single gradient descent step on any teacher-generated output necessarily moves a student toward the teacher's parameters, regardless of the training distribution. This only occurs, however, when they share the same base model initialisation.
This could pose new risks for AI development. Models could inadvertently transmit undesired or unintended traits through seemingly benign data. Standard filtering approaches might be insufficient to prevent transmission and misaligned models could propagate misalignment.

    When applied to Claude 3.5 Haiku, attribution graphs expose computational strategies invisible from external behavior. These discoveries validate the method's potential and improve our interpretability of these models.

Early applications of attribution graphs reveal internal mechanisms

 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Models perform genuine multi-step reasoning internally. When asked "what’s the capital of the state containing Dallas", Claude Haiku 3.5 executes "Dallas → Texas → Austin" as distinct steps.
Medical diagnosis also mirrors clinical thinking. Given symptoms suggesting preeclampsia, the model internally activates "preeclampsia" features without any mention in the prompt, then searches for confirmatory symptoms.
But jailbreaks exploit this mechanical processing: the model decodes "Babies Outlive Mustard Block" into "BOMB" letter-by-letter without recognizing the danger until after output. Attribution graphs revealed why: safety circuits don’t activate during obfuscated decoding, but only after seeing its own harmful output.
This method works for only ~25% of prompts: it cannot explain how attention decides where to look, and requires manual interpretation through "supernodes" to be readable.

    LLMs’ “personalities” are poorly understood, and can shift dramatically. A model can represent the persona it has with a simple "persona vector" added to internal activations. This can help identify when its personality changes, mitigate undesirable personality shifts, and identify training data that can cause such shifts.
stateof.ai 2025
 | 272
Personality engineering with persona vectors
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Activation engineering is used to extract persona vectors (model activations when it exhibits a given trait), and validate these using steering (artificially injecting these vectors into the model and observing behavioral changes). 
Personality monitoring could allow us to intervene when models drift towards undesired traits, or help users know if they’re being flattered (if the “sycophancy” vector is very active). Alternatively, we could have another LLM read the response and determine if it’s sycophantic…
Importantly, by steering the model towards undesired vectors during training, models were made more resilient to these vectors in training data (akin to vaccination). This didn’t degrade model capabilities (MMLU).
Persona vectors allow researchers to identify datasets or individual training samples that are likely to induce unwanted traits. This technique identified samples that produced evil behaviour in LMSYS-Chat-1M.

As capable agents enter critical workflows, capability-based designs should become a safety baseline rather than an optional add-on. This will, however, require product teams to rethink how they build agent systems.
CaMeL wraps the LLM in a tightly scoped execution environment, breaking tasks into minimal-privilege capability calls. Every interaction between the model, external tools, and sensitive data sources is mediated and auditable, preventing injected instructions from escalating privileges or exfiltrating data. 
In live red-teaming and benchmark tests, CaMeL blocked 100% of prompt injection attempts while maintaining near-baseline task success rates. 
    Prompt injection remains one of the most persistent vulnerabilities in LLM-based systems, with current defenses relying on patchwork filtering or after-the-fact classifiers. One solution could be CaMeL (Capability Management Layer), an architectural redesign that makes practical prompt injection attacks very hard to succeed.

    Researchers argue that AI can erode human agency incrementally as systems that run the economy, culture, and politics decouple from human participation. A useful intuition is the “intelligence curse,” by analogy to the resource curse: once AI supplies most productive labor, states and firms rely less on citizens for taxes and work, so incentives to invest in people shrink and we end up with mass unemployment.

Gradual disempowerment and the “intelligence curse”
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
As AI substitutes for human labor and cognition, explicit levers (votes, consumer choice) and implicit alignment from human dependence weaken, and effects reinforce across domains.  ￼
The intelligence-curse lens predicts rent-seeking: AI-derived “rents” reduce pressure to keep citizens productive and politically empowered, similar to how resource windfalls can degrade institutions.  ￼
Feedback loops follow: AI profits fund rules that favor further automation. Less human relevance justifies more automation, risking an effectively irreversible loss of human influence.

There are no “tamper-proof” open models today: only tamper-resistant ones under narrow threat models. Governance and release decisions should be designed accordingly.

Multi-stage pretraining filters and safety objectives can make models resist simple adversarial fine-tunes and do so with little general-task loss and low extra compute.
But targeted fine-tuning on the order of 100Ms tokens can largely recover original capabilities and stacking stronger mitigations still loses to stacked attacks. So we must treat defenses as cost-raising friction, not prevention.
For high-risk domains (bio, cyber), helpful and harmful knowledge overlap. We could release models that are weak on these domains, and keep capable models behind API with monitoring and abuse controls, while recognizing even API-gated models can be finetuned once weights leak.
    Data-centric “tamper-resistance” helps, but open weights remain inherently modifiable. Filtering and safety-tuned pretraining can raise the cost of adversarial fine-tuning, yet motivated actors can still re-enable capabilities. Policymakers should assume open access brings both benefits and persistent misuse risk.

But major powers must agree to restrict their own AI development and enforce limits on others despite massive economic incentives to defect and no existing international institutions capable of verification or enforcement. Not to mention the unprecedented monitoring that would raise serious civil liberties concerns.
They introduce the concept of Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM): a deterrence regime resembling nuclear mutual assured destruction where any state’s aggressive bid for unilateral AI dominance is met with preventive sabotage by rivals.
Argues we must adopt three pillars (see: figure). 
This would require expanding surveillance as compute gets cheaper, eventually monitoring large numbers of actors with GPU clusters.

First demos trigger fast replication cost drops once methods and know-how circulate.
Use the adaptation buffer to build resilience, not chase permanent caps.
Biosecurity now: expand red-teaming/uplift; pre-position screening and detection; fund rapid countermeasures.
Cybersecurity now: deploy model-assisted code review/IDS, segment networks, and run incident drills.
Short-term levers: keep top models private briefly; improve capability forecasting and triggers.
Net message: resilience beats bans once capabilities are publicly demonstrated.
    Toner’s argument is that proliferation is inevitable, so policy should maximize defensive preparation during the short window between frontier demonstration and wide access. Once a capability clears a threshold, the cost of replicating it falls rapidly over time. The priority is to use that “adaptation buffer” to harden society rather than to chase permanent bans.

Paths forward: 3) Implement science-first policy
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    We can both avoid rushed legislation based on hype and not be paralysed waiting for perfect evidence.
Major AI policy decisions are being made with limited scientific understanding of risks and impacts.
Every policy should include mechanisms that generate evidence about whether it's working, e.g.
Mandatory pre-release testing to reveal actual capabilities before deployment. Here, the UK’s AISI is doing a promising job so far.
Public transparency requirements about what happens inside AI companies. This is, admittedly, still lacking. 
We could create "if-then protocols", i.e. pre-commit to specific actions when certain evidence emerges (e.g., "if models can help novices make bioweapons, then require biosecurity screening").
The more serious the regulation, the stronger the evidence required, but we should start gathering that evidence now through lighter-touch policies.

OpenAI and Anthropic test each other’s models on safety evals for the first time
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    The goal of this work was to explore model propensities, the kinds of concerning behaviors models might attempt, and not to conduct full threat modeling or estimating real-world likelihoods of bad behaviors. The tests were run prior to the launch of GPT-5. 
Anthropic reports o3 looked as well or better aligned than Claude on most axes, while GPT-4o/4.1 and o4-mini were more willing to assist misuse. Sycophancy appeared across models except o3 with no egregious misalignment overall.
OpenAI finds Claude strongest on instruction-hierarchy and prompt-extraction, while o3/o4-mini held up better on jailbreaking. Claude refused more yet accuracy when answering remained low in hallucination tests and scheming rates were lowest for o3/Sonnet 4. 
Surprisingly, reasoning didn’t always make models safer, and sometimes smaller models outperformed their larger peers. 

Anthropic seemed to conclude that this wasn’t an effective use of their time, saying that this will be only a small part of their eval portfolio given the substantial logistical investment required.

China turns up the heat on AI Safety
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    Researchers warn that US assumptions about China ignoring AI safety are wrong: Beijing is implementing strong safeguards, integrating AI safety into China’s National Emergency Response Plan (alongside pandemics and cyberattacks) and removing 3,500 non-compliant AI products from the market. 
Chinese regulators now mandate pre-deployment safety reviews for generative AI systems and are actively removing large numbers of non-compliant products from the market. 
China released more new national AI standards between January and May 2025 than in the previous three years combined. 
High-ranking tech official Ding Xuexiang said “it's impossible to safely step on the accelerator without first properly controlling the brakes” at the World Economic Forum 2025. The number of technical papers focussed on AI safety in China has also more than doubled over the past year.
China has launched bilateral AI safety dialogues with both the U.S. and the UK, underscoring willingness to collaborate internationally.

…yet China’s safety practices have not fully converged with the West
 Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
    Unlike the Western AI safety landscape, leading Chinese frontier labs have not yet embraced the same levels of transparency and much of the country’s testing remains heavily focused on content moderation. 

Recent reports indicate DeepSeek has conducted frontier risk evaluations. Other labs like ByteDance maintain safety-relevant teams (e.g. Seed-Responsible AI). However, there has not been a single Chinese AI lab to publish a system card documenting the specific safety mechanisms deployed around one of their released systems.


Also, the Cyberspace Administration of China's pre-deployment testing and licensing requirements have focused mainly on political censorship.  
However, version 2.0 of TC260’s AI Safety Governance Framework has pivoted closer to the frameworks instituted by American labs with sections on CBRN, cyber, and self-awareness risks.

    “Wow” moments for users focused on AI's rapidly advancing capabilities, particularly in tangible, high-skill areas. Coding was the most frequently cited surprise, with users amazed by AI's ability to build entire applications and debug complex problems.

    The clearest trend is the adoption of specialized coding tools such as Claude Code and Cursor, which correlates with users stopping the use of GitHub Copilot and, to a lesser extent, ChatGPT for coding tasks. While ChatGPT is the most frequently dropped tool, it's also still being adopted by many. Gemini and Claude are the primary beneficiaries of this churn, with many users citing better performance or specific features like long context windows as their reason for switching. Users are also dropping single-purpose tools, e.g. Midjourney and Perplexity as the main platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini) integrate these capabilities directly.
