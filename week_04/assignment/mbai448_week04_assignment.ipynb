    "\n",
    "##### Assignment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment explores how deep learning can be applied to a real-world quality control problem in manufacturing. It is organized into three Acts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Act I: Understand the problem and context\n",
    "- Act II: Prototype a solution with AI technology\n",
    "- Act III: Socialize the work with stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Assignment Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment assumes you will be working with GitHub Copilot in VS Code or Google Colab, and will require you to submit your chat history along with this notebook. If you are curious about how to work effectively with GitHub Copilot, please consult the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions that demonstrate thoughtless interaction with Copilot (e.g., asking Copilot to just read the notebook and produce all the outputs) will receive reduced credit."

    "##### 1. What we're building\n",
    "A one-sentence \"elevator pitch\" describing the prototype and its primary output (e.g., \"An automated defect detection system that classifies manufacturing components as defective or non-defective using deep learning.\").\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. How AI helps solve the business problem\n",
    "2–4 bullet points explaining the specific value-add of the AI components. Focus on the transition from the business \"pain point\" to the AI \"solution.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Key file locations and data structure\n",
    "List the paths that matter (e.g., `./mbai448_week04_assignment.ipynb`, `./images.zip/...`).\n",

    "- **Validate**: Review and refine that plan to ensure it does exactly what the step requires—no more, no less.\n",

    "- **Check**: Perform one or two concrete actions that confirm the code worked and that you understand the result.\n",
