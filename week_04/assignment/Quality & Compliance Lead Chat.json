This requires explainability tools (e.g., saliency maps, confidence scores) and clear documentation of model training, validation, and deployment processes.\n\n- **Risk Management:** If a defective part slips through, the consequences can be severe—product recalls, regulatory penalties, or even safety incidents. I must assess the model’s false negative rate, monitor for concept drift, and implement layered controls (e.g., periodic human inspection, threshold tuning) to mitigate risk.\n\n- **Audit Readiness:** Regulators may require evidence that the system is reliable and that we have processes for continuous monitoring, retraining, and incident response. I need to maintain detailed records of model updates, performance metrics, and compliance checks.\n\n- **Reliability in Critical Contexts:** The system’s reliability must be proven, not assumed.
